This file contains a list of all known bugs in the original Sierra
games. We try our best to work around these bugs in FreeSCI. Often,
when creating these workarounds, we make FreeSCI output warning
messages, so that they are easily identifiable using the below list.


1. Codename: Iceman displays the warning "NodeValue() on a NULL
   pointer attempted" at numerous points during the map table scene.

2. Quest for Glory 1 displays the warning "List node at x is not sane
   anymore" when the dinosaur snaps at you during the intro. 

3. Space Quest 3 calls functions from a script which has already been
   unloaded when Roger climbs up the ladder from the rat cave (the
   place containing the reactor at the very beginning of the game).
   This does not currently cause a warning, but may do so in later
   VM implementations.

4. PQ2 calls CanBeHere() with a disposed object in the clip list when
   Keith enters the car.

5. LSL2 tries to allocate zero bytes of memory when entering Molto Lira.
