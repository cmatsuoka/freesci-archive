This file contains a list of all known bugs in the original Sierra
games. We try our best to work around these bugs in FreeSCI. Often,
when creating these workarounds, we make FreeSCI output warning
messages, so that they are easily identifiable using the below list.


1. Codename: Iceman displays the warning "NodeValue() on a NULL
   pointer attempted" at numerous points during the map table scene.

2. Quest for Glory 1 displays the warning "List node at x is not sane
   anymore" when the dinosaur snaps at you during the intro.
