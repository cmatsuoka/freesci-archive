Some tips on writing portable code for FreeSCI:

 - Always provide prototypes for all external functions and variables
   referenced from your code. Absence of a prototype causes a warning
   in GNU, but it is an error in Visual C++.
 - Do not use varargs macros. This is a GNU extension not supported by
   Visual C++. For a way to replace varargs macros, see
   src/include/kdebug.h.
 - Do not use the __FUNCTION__ macro. This is a GNU extension not
   supported by Visual C++.
 - Do not use the mkdir() function, since it has a different number of
   arguments on Unix and Win32. Use the scimkdir() macro instead.
 - Do not use the ffs() function. It is not available in the Visual C++
   runtime. Use the sci_ffs() macro instead.
 - When you declare a function returning int, please make sure that it
   has a return statement in it. This is not an error in Visual C++, but
   it produces a warning that is very easy to avoid.
