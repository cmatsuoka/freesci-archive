	* Re-enable save_game and restore_game debug console commands



NOTES:


Reference counting for scripts
==============================
Two separate kinds of reference counts must be kept: The 'active' count and the
'dependancy' count. A script must be available if either count is non-zero.

Active count
------------
  The active count is either 0 or 1. It is set to 1 whenever script code
instantiates the script (by doing a 'class' call, a 'calle', or a
'callk ScriptID'). It is set to 0 whenever 'callk DisposeScript' is invoked
upon it.

Dependancy count
----------------
  This count gives the number of currently loaded/cloned objects and classes
which, directly or indirectly, depend on this script. It is increased and
decreased recursively upon object/class cloning, script instantiation and
script uninstantiation.


Encoding
--------
  Storing these in the same integer and identifying the active count with the
LSB allows checking for whether the script has already been loaded with a
single comparison. Operations for this are:

-- Lock active		: refcount |= 1
-- Unlock active	: refcount &= ~1;
-- Add dependancy	: refcount += 2;
-- Remove dependancy	: refcount -= 2;
-- Check dependancy	: if (refcount) ...
