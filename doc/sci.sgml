   <para>
    Throughout the documentation, the term SCI will be used to describe the original
    Sierra Creative Interpreter, in any version. SCI0 will refer to all games using the
    SCI version 0.xxx, except for those games who use the 'in-between' game engine
    referred to as SCI01 (such as Quest for Glory 2). SCI1 will refer to the interpreter
    version 1.xxx, and SCI2 to interpreter version 2.xxx.
    FreeSCI will refer specifically to either implementation details of the FreeSCI
    engine or to extensions of the original SCI engine specific to FreeSCI.
   </para>
   <para>
   I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the FreeSCI
   and SCI Decoding Projects and their supporters, as well as Carl Muckenhoupt,
   who took the first steps of SCI decoding, for their valuable help and
   support.

 <Chapter>
 <Title/Introduction/
<sect1>
<Title/The basics/
<para>
The Sierra Creative Interpreter is a complete virtual machine. It cointains
functionality for displaying graphics, playing sound, receiving input, writing
data to the hard disk, and handling complex logical functions.
In version 0.xxx of the interpreter, Sierra split the game data into nine
different types of information:
<simpleList>
<member/script data/
<member/vocab data/
<member/patch data/
<member/sound data/
<member/cursor data/
<member/view data/
<member/pic data/
<member/font data/
<member/text data/
</simpleList>
</para>
<para>
Each game may contain up to 1000 different elements of each data type; these
elements are referred to as "resources". The index numbers of the various
resources need not be in sequence; they are usually assigned arbitrarily.
<Footnote><para>With several notable exceptions, used mainly by the debugger.</para></Footnote>
</para>
</sect1>
<sect1>
<title/Resource storage/
<para>
Individual resources can be stored in one of two ways: Either in resource files
(which, surprisingly, are called something like "resource.000" or
"resource.001"), or in external patch files (not to be confused with "patch"
resources). The external files are called something like "pic.100" or
"script.000", and they take precedence over data from resource files.
</para>
<para>
There is also a file called "resource.map", which contains a lookup table for
the individual resources, and another file, "resource.cfg", which contains
configuration information; neither of those is used by FreeSCI.
</para>
<para>
Resource information stored in external patch files is not compressed and
therefore easily readable. It is, however, preceeded by two bytes:
The first byte contains the resource type ORed with 0x80, the purpose of the
second byte is unknown (but it appears to be ignored by the original SCI
version 0 engine).
</para>
<para>
As stated before, external patch files take precedence over resource resource
files. Applying those external files as patches is an option since FreeSCI
version 0.2.2.
</para>
<para>
The resource files, however, are more complicated. Each of them contains a
sequence of resources preceeded by a header; these resources may be compressed.
It is, also, quite common to find resources shared by several resource files.
The reason for this obviously is that, back when hard disks were rare and hard
to come by, the games had to be playable from floppy disks. To prevent
unneccessary disk-jockeying, common stuff was placed in several resource files,
each of which was then stored on one disk.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title/The individual resources: A summary/
<para>
The resource types of SCI0 can be roughly grouped into four sets:
<itemizedlist>
<ListItem><para>Graphics (pic, view, font, cursor)</para></ListItem>
<ListItem><para/Sound (patch, sound)/</ListItem>
<ListItem><para/Logic (script, vocab)/</ListItem>
<ListItem><para/Text/</ListItem>
</itemizedList>

Text resources are nothing more than a series of ASCIIZ strings; but the other
resources deserve further discussion.

</para>
<sect2>
<Title/Graphical resources summarized/
<para>
The screen graphics are compromised of the four graphics resources. The
background pictures are drawn using vector-oriented commands from at least one
pic resource (several resources may be overlaid). The fact that vector graphics
were used for SCI0 allows for several interesting picture quality improvements.
Pic resources also include two additional "screens": The priority screen, which
marks parts of the pictures with a certain priority, so that other things with
less priority can be fully or partially covered by them even if they are drawn
at a later time, and the special screen, which delimits the walking area and
some special places used by the game logic. FreeSCI uses a fourth auxiliary
screen for during drawing time (this is a heritage from Carl Muckenhoupt's
original code).
</para>
<para>
The view resources compromise the bitmaps of the game. They are somewhat
compressed, and include transparency information. Also, each view resource may
contain several animation "loops" consisting of one or more "cells", each of
which is an image.
</para>
<para>
View resources are used for foreground images as well as for background images
(for example, the "Spielburg" sign in QfG1 (EGA) is stored in a view resource
and added to the background picture after it is drawn).
The cursor resource contains simple bitmaps for drawing the mouse pointer. It
only allows for black, white, and transparent pixels in SCI0.
The fourth graphics resource is font data. It contains bitmapped fonts which
are used to draw most of the text in the games. Text is used in one of four
places: Text boxes, Text input fields, the title bar menu, and (rarely)
on-screen.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<Title/Sound resources summarized/
<para>
SCI0 uses two types of resources for sound: Patch resources, and sound
resources. Sound resources contain a rather simple header, and music data
stored in a slightly modified version of the MIDI standard.
</para>
<para>
Patch resources contain device-dependant instrument mapping information for the
instruments used in the sound resources. SCI0 sound resources do not adhere to
the General Midi (GM) standard (which was, to my knowledge, written several
years after the first SCI0 game was released), though later SCI versions may do
so.
</para>
<para>
Since FreeSCI currently only takes advantage of GM output, it maps the
instruments according to strings taken from patch resource 002 (Used by the
IMF/FB01 sound device, whatever that may be). This works almost adequately.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title/Logic resources summarized/
<para>
Whenever the parser needs to look up a word, it looks for it in one of
the vocab resources. This is not the sole purpose of the vocab resources,
though; they provide information required by the debugger, including the help
text for the debugger help menu and the names of the various SCI opcodes
and kernel functions.
</para><para>
Script resources are the heart (or, rather, the brains) of the game. They
contain commands to load and display resources, to react on certain actions,
and generally to find out what happens next.
</para><para>
To be more precise, scripts are composed of classes and class data.
To run the game, scripts are instantiated on the SCI stack, where their
functions are executed by a virtual machine. They use a set of 0x7d opcodes,
which may take either 8 or 16 bit parameters (so, effectively, there is twice
the amount of commands). The functions may refer to global data, local temporary
data, local function parameter data, or object data (selectors). They may,
additionally, indirectly refer to "hunk" data, which is stored outside of the
SCI heap. Since the whole design is object oriented, functions may
re-use or overload the functions of their superclass, which allows for a quite
powerful design.
</para><para>
One of the most powerful things functions can do is to call a kernel command.
This is the SCI equivalent to a system call as provided by traditional
operating systems. These kernel commands are practically unexplored, but we can
safely assume that they are used to perform tasks like playing a song, drawing
an image, waiting for a key, changing the mouse pointer appearance, or loading
a save game file.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title/SCI01 extensions/
<para>
SCI01 differs only in very few respects: It uses different compression
algorithms (all of which are supported since FreeSCI 0.2.1), and a
different type of sound resources, which may contain digitized sound effects
(samples). The basic music data, however, still resembles MIDI data. It has not
been examined yet.
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1>
<title/SCI1 extensions/
<para>
SCI1, which is not covered by FreeSCI at the moment, introduces new concepts
like Palettes, scaled bitmap images and several new compression algorithms.
</para>
</sect1>

 <Title/General stuff/
 <para>
 The graphics in SCI are generated using four resource types:
 <itemizedlist>
 <listitem><para/Pic resources for background pictures/</listitem>
 <listitem><para/View resources for images/</listitem>
 <listitem><para/Font resources for drawing text/</listitem>
 <listitem><para/Cursor resources for displaying the mouse pointer/</listitem>

 Those resources are drawn on three distinct screens:
 <itemizedlist>
 <listitem><para/The visual screen, used for displaying the actual pictures the player sees/</listitem>

 <Title/SCI Ports/
 <para>
 <author><firstname/Lars/ <surname/Skovlund/ </author>

</para><para>
  Version 1.0,
  6. July 1999
</para><para>
 Note that the observations made in this document are
generally based on SCI version 0.000.572 (the one that comes with LSL3),
but should be valid even for SCI01 and SCI1, as well. I know already
about
some differences in the port system from SCI0 to SCI1, but I feel we
should
have an interpreter running for SCI0 before dealing with SCI1.
</para><para>
This article discusses a key data structure in SCI graphics handling;
this data structure is called a port, and it is involved in most
graphics-related
operations. The port is basically a graphics state record, storing
things
like pen color, current font, cursor position etc. Each port also has
an origin and a size. The actual port data structure has remained
absolutely
unchanged from SCI0 up to the latest versions of SCI1. 
</para><para>
The port can be viewed as a rectangle in which things are drawn. Every
drawing operation (even KDrawPic) is executed relative to the origin
coordinates of the current port (depending on the kernel function, other
parameters in the port structure are used as well), such that coordinate
(0, 0) in the "picture window" (such a thing really exists in SCI!) is
<emphasis/not/ the top of the screen, but rather the leftmost point underneath
the menu bar. The coordinate set (0,0) is called the local coordinates,
and its physical position on the screen, (0, 10), is called the global
coordinates. Kernel calls exist to ease conversion between the two
coordinate
systems, but they are, it appears, meant for event handlers to use, and
not generally usable (I think they take a pointer to an Event object as
a
parameter).
</para><para>
At least three ports are created and managed automatically by the SCI
interpreter. These are the "window manager" port, the menu port, and the
picture port (which is actually a window, see later). The latter two
should be fairly easy to understand. The menu bar is drawn in the menu
port,
and the current room is drawn in the picture port. What may be less
obvious
is that the window manager port is an "invisible" port, on which the
window
backgrounds are drawn, although the windows have a port themselves. If
you
are familiar with <Trademark>Windows</trademark>
programming, the term "client rectangle" may
ring a
bell here - SCI draws the window backgrounds, using values in the window
manager port, while the window's own port controls what is drawn inside
it.
The window manager port covers the same bounding rectangle as the
picture
window, but it is transparent so it doesn't mess up the graphics.
</para><para>
I feel compelled to mention windows for a bit here, not in depth - they
are
the subject of a later article - but just to mention that the structure
used
to manage windows is just an extension of the port structure. Whenever
an
SCI system call needs a pointer to a port structure, a pointer to a
window
structure will do. This implicates that the SysWindow class (which
implements
windows) has no "port" property. Instead, its "window" property points
to the
extended port/window structure which can safely be passed to KSetPort.
Not
surprisingly, many of KNewWindow's arguments end up in the port part of
the
window structure.
</para><para>
An SCI program can't directly instantiate a port. If a program wants to
access a specific part of the screen using ports, it has to instantiate
a
transparent window. In fact, SCI creates the picture window using
RNewWindow,
the same function that the kernel call KNewWindow ends up calling,
asking for
an untitled window with a transparent background - but more on that in a
later article.
</para><para>
It must be stressed that ports are purely internal structures. Although
a
program can select different ports to draw in, the data structures
themselves
are absolutely off-limits to SCI code. KNewWindow fills a port structure
with
user-supplied data, but there is no way of changing that data, short of
dis-
posing the window and instantiating it again. The structure is
frequently
changed by SCI itself, though.
</para><para>
Only two kernel calls deal directly with ports:
</para><para>
<simpleList>
<member>KGetPort (see <XREF LINKEND="KGetPort">)</member>
<member>KSetPort (see <XREF LINKEND="KSetPort">)</member>
</simplelist>
</para><para>
These two functions are often used in pairs (also internally), like:
</para><para><programlisting>
var temp;

temp=KGetPort();  /* Save the old port */
KSetPort(...);      /* Activate some other port */
..                            /* Draw some stuff */
KSetPort(temp);    /* Reactivate the old port */
</programlisting>
 </para>

        This is a list of 16 unsigned 16 bit integers constituting bitmasks for the

        This is another list of 16 unsigned 16 bit integers. Each of them represents

        </para>
   </ListItem></VarListEntry></VariableList>
   To determine whether or not to draw a pixel, and, if it is to be drawn, in which
   color it should be drawn in, the corresponding bits of both bitmask lists mentioned
   above have to be examined. In the table below, A represents a bit from
   the first list, and B the corresponding bit from the lower list.

  <Title/The SCI0 View Resource/
   <para>
    In SCI0, Views are collections of images or sprites. Each View resource
    contains a number of groups, which, in turn, contain one or more images.
    Usually, those groups contain a number of consecutive animation frames.
    It appears to be customary to store related animations or images in a
    single frame. For example, the basic movements of all protagonists (four
    or eight animation cycles (depending on the game)) are stored inside of
    a single View resource.
    Please note that the byte order of the following data is always little endian.

Version 1.0, 7. July 1999
</para><para>
I am going to start by mentioning the menus. It has nothing to do with the
material I deal with in this essay. They use different kernel calls, and
such things as port management are handled internally by the kernel 
routines.
The SCI program just sets up a menu structure using the kernel calls.
Since they are irrelevant to the subject of this essay, I will not spend 
more
time on them.
</para><para>
The Rect structure is important (also to ports) since it is the basis for
passing a screen position to the interpreter. It looks like this:
</para><para>
<programlisting>
typedef struct
{
  short top, left, bottom, right;
}
</programlisting>
</para><para>
It will be seen from this that rectangle coordinates in SCI are not normally
 represented in the usual (x,y,width,height) fashion. So pay close attention
 to this structure! Also, it is not passed as a pointer, but rather as
the four values in order. This is particularly true of SCI objects, where
the property names nsTop etc. actually form a Rect structure which can be
used directly by the interpreter.
</para><para>
Windows are created using the KNewWindow kernel function. Each window has
six attributes which are passed from the script to the kernel function:
</para><para>
<simplelist>
<member/Bounding rectangle/
<member/Title/
<member/Type/
<member/Priority/
<member/Foreground color/
<member/Background color/
</simplelist>
</para><para>
Of these, the type and priority are the most interesting, because they 
decide
the appearance of the window. The type is a bit field:
</para><para>
<simplelist>
<member/bit 0 - transparency/
<member/bit 1 - window does _not_ have a frame/
<member/bit 2 - the window has a title/
<member/bit 3-6 - unused/
<member/bit 7 - see below/
</simplelist>
</para><para>
Bit 0 specifies a transparent window. KNewWindow does not save the image
behind the created window - it stays on the screen until the pic is redrawn,
so windows with this style definitely can't be used as message boxes. It 
does
have some special uses, though. If this bit is not set, KNewWindow draws
a rectangle in the specified background color using the bounding rectangle
coordinates (using the WM port). When this bit is set,
</para><para>
Bit 1 specifies a window without a frame. The frame is the black shading you
can see in the corner of a message box.
</para><para>
Bit 2 tells KNewWindow to draw a grey title bar with a title printed in
white. In the version I have used for this essay, it is not possible to
change the title bar colors. Note that the bounding rectangle is always
specified as if the window had no title bar. If this bit is set, ten pixels
are reserved above the coordinates specified. Although this bit is set,
the Title parameter may still be NULL. If this is the case, an empty title
bar is drawn.
</para><para>
Bit 7 has a special meaning; it is used only in window type 0x81, and is not
tested in any other way. When this style is chosen, KNewWindow does not
draw anything at all. It is the caller's responsibility to draw a
window frame on the WM port. CB1 uses this style for its ornate windows,
and draws the frame manually.
</para><para>
The picture window which I mentioned in the last article is created using
style 3 (that is, TRANSPARENT | NOFRAME). The normal message box styles used
in LSL3 are 0 and 4.
</para><para>
I have not been able to investigate the priority property yet, so the fol-
lowing is based on suppositions. It is only used when drawing transparent
windows. In this case, if priority is not -1 (which means not used), the
window is drawn onto the priority map (with the specified priority value) as
well as the screen.
</para><para>
There is a class called SysWindow which is just a simple wrapper around the
following two kernel calls. Try breaking on SysWindow::open, then type c
to inspect the current object. You can change all the parameters to KNewWin-
dow (the Rect is split in its fields, to nsTop, nsLeft etc.)
</para><para>
To create a window structure, use KNewWindow (see <XREF LINKEND="KNewWindow">);
to remove it again, apply KDisposeWindow (see <XREF LINKEND="KDisposeWindow">) on
it.
</para><para>
So how do we put stuff inside these windows? That question is a little com-
plicated to answer, because it is really a shared effort between the inter-
preter and the object hierarchy, and this is one case where the interpreter
actually interacts with the objects itself. I will start by explaining the
classes involved.
</para><para>
All control types are descendants of a common class (I do not know its name,
since it appears to have an invalid name property). Among other things, this
common class contains a type number and a state. The type number is the only
thing that distinguishes the control types from each other inside the
interpreter - if a wrong type is set, the interpreter might try to change
a non-existent property.
</para><para>
The type numbers are laid out as follows:
<simplelist>
<member/  1 - Button control/
<member/  2 - Text control/
<member/  3 - Edit control/
<member/  4 - Icon control/
<member/  5 - not used/
<member/  6 - Selector control (as in the Save and Restore boxes)/
</simplelist>
The gauge "controls" are not really controls. I don't know how they work
(yet).
</para><para>
Each control also has a state value. These are laid out as follows:
<simplelist>
<member/bit 0 - selectable. If this bit is set, the control can be selected using 
the
Tab key. Except for the text and icon controls, all controls are selectable./
<member/bit 1 - unknown. Always set, except for the text and icon controls/
<member/bit 2 - disabled. When this bit is set, a button is grayed out. No other
control types are affected./
<member/bit 3 - selected. When this bit is set, a frame is drawn around the control./
</simplelist>
Note that state 3 is by far the most common.
With that explained, I'll move on to the kernel functions. There are three
functions associated with controls - KDrawControl (see <XREF LINKEND="KDrawControl">),
KHiliteControl (see <XREF LINKEND="KHiliteControl">) and
KEditControl (see <XREF LINKEND="KEditControl">).
 Note that there is a KOnControl kernel call which is entirely
unrelated to window management.
</para><para>
The dialogs are implemented using not one, but two classes - Dialog and
Window. While the Window class maintains the window (It is derived from
SysWindow), the Dialog class is just a list of controls. It is derived from
the List class, but has extended functionality to tell its members to redraw
etc. There is a special function, located in script 255, which allows
scripts to push information about the dialog on the stack instead of 
creating
the Dialog object manually.
</para><note><para>
Note that the internal debugger uses the same window calls as the SCI 
script.
That is why the screen messes up if you step through drawing code - the debugger has
 activated the Debug window port, and "forgets" to switch back
while stepping across instructions. Thus, all graphics commands are
redirected to the debug window port. Not a pretty sight.

   <para>By<author><firstname/Lars/<surname/Skovlund/</author></para>
   <para/Version 1.0, 24. July 1999/
   <para>
A pic in SCI consists of three layers (called maps - they are unrelated to
the map resources found in SCI1 gamers). The visual map, used for the
picture which appears on the user's screen. The priority map which tells the
interpreter which things go in front of which in the three-dimensional room.
Without the priority map, a room would just be a flat, painted surface.
The control map decides where game characters (called actors) can walk and
where special events occur. These special events are triggered by a game
character walking on a particular spot. Where the visual map is almost
always very complex and using dithered fills etc., the latter two consist of
large areas of solid color.
</para><para>
Many functions which need to access these maps do so by using a bit-field.
The bits are laid out as follows (but don't set more than one at a time!)
<simplelist>
<member/bit 0 - Visual/
<member/bit 1 - Priority/
<member/bit 2 - Control/
</simplelist>
</para><para>
It is important to understand that, although being represented as colors on
the screen, a priority/control "color" should be considered a number.
The colors map to values according to the standard EGA color values.
</para><para>
Every animated object in SCI has a priority. As the object moves, its pri-
ority changes according to the so-called priority bands, explained next
(it is, however, possible for a script to lock the priority of a view).
The picture window is divided vertically into 16 priority bands. The
priority of an animated object is determined by the position of its
"base rectangle" in one of these bands. Things are drawn in order of
ascending priority, so objects with priority 15 are guaranteed to be in 
front
of everything else. The default priority mapping gives priority 0 a fairly
large space, the 42 topmost rows (including the menu bar which AFAIK is 10) 
in the picture. All other priority
bands have the same size. A script can choose to alter this mapping,
specifying the amount of space to assign to priority 0, and the number of 
the
last row to include in the mapping calculation.
</para><para>
In most rooms, it is desirable to limit actor movement, confining the
actor to a specific part of the screen. In other cases, special events
are triggered by movement into a specific screen area. On some occasions,
even room switches are implemented using control polygons. While the meaning
of priorities is determined by the kernel, the meaning of control values
is entirely up to the script. It is more or less a standard, however, that
actors can't walk on white control areas.
</para><para>
As the control map is not consulted by the interpreter itself (except in a
few cases), scripts need a way to do so. That way is called OnControl, and
it is a kernel call. Supplied with a point or a rectangle, it returns a bit
mask containing the control values of all the pixels in the desired region.
If a specific control value is encountered, it is used as a bit number, and
that bit is set in the output mask.
</para><para>
This bit mask system is also used in another place, namely the illegalBits
selector of the Act (actor) class. The illegalBits selector determines in
which areas the actor may not walk.

The OnControl() system call is explained in <XREF LINKEND="KONCONTROL">.

       Revision 5, Jul. 5th, 1999
     </para>
     <sect2><Title/Preface/
      <para>
   Sierra's SCI0 sound resources contain the music and sound effects played
   in the game. With the introduction of SCI, the company took advantage of
   new sound hardware which allowed for far better music than the traditional
   PC speaker could ever create. Sierra chose two devices to specifically
   target: the MT-32, and the Adlib. The MT-32 is a MIDI synth while the
   Adlib is a less expensive card based around the OPL2, a non-MIDI chip.
   Anyone interested in Sierra music and its history can find information at
   the Sierra Soundtrack Series (http://www.queststudios.com).
      </para><para>
   Music is stored as a series of MIDI events, and the sound resource is
   basically just a MIDI file. Much of what I write here comes from outside
   documents, and I would direct anyone seeking more information to a MIDI
   specification. The MIDI resource page (http://www.midi.org/resource.htm)
   on midi.org has some good links as well as tables with status and
   control information.
      </para><para>
   Some people prefer the one-based numbering system for channel and program
   numbers. I personally prefer the zero-based system, and use it here. If
   you're familiar with channels 1-16, be aware that I will call them 0-15.
   My intention is not to be deviant from other programs but to be more
   accurate in representing the way information gets stored. The same is true
   for programs 0-127 as opposed to 1-128. For whatever reason, convention
   already holds that controls be numbered 0-127, so nothing in my treatment
   of them should be abnormal.
      </para><para>
   Sierra changed its sound file format in the switch to SCI1. I refer only
   to SCI0 sound files in this specification. Hybrid interpreters such as
   the one used for Quest for Glory II are also excluded. Finally, SCI games
   written for non-DOS systems may have different formats. This document
   applies to Sierra's IBM games.
      </para>
 </sect2><sect2><title/Sound Devices/
  <para>
   A gamer's sound hardware greatly affects how the music will sound. Devices
   used by SCI0 can be broken into 3 categories:
  <variablelist>
      <varlistentry><term>MIDI Synths</term><listitem><para>
                   These will generally give the best sound quality. MIDI
                   synths are polyphonic with defineable instruments through
                   patch files and full support for MIDI controls. The
                   General MIDI standard had not been written when Sierra
                   began writing SCI games, and as far as I know no SCI0 game
                   uses a GM driver or includes a GM track. This means that
                   synths had to be individually supported.
            </para></listitem></varlistentry>
      <varlistentry><term>Non-MIDI Synths</term><listitem><para>
                   Generally not as good as MIDI synths, but also less
                   expensive. The OPLx family of chips are still very common
                   among home PC users thanks to the Adlib and SoundBlaster
                   cards. Synths are polyphonic with defineable instruments
                   through patch files, but drivers must be written to
                   interpret MIDI events and turn them into commands the
                   hardware will recognize. Support for most sound controls
                   gets lost in the process. Furthermore, drivers must map
                   logical, polyphonic MIDI channels to physical, monophonic
                   hardware channels. A specific control was introduced for
                   this purpose and will be discussed later. There is no
                   common way of accessing these devices, so they must be
                   individually supported. These days, however, most people
                   have an Adlib compatible card.
            </para></listitem></varlistentry>
      <varlistentry><term/Beepers/<listitem><para>
                   Beepers produce very poor music and don't support instrument
                   definitions, but all PC users have one so supporting them
                   covers people without special sound hardware. The most
                   common device is the PC speaker, which is monophonic.
                   Another is the Tandy speaker with 3 channels. Drivers must
                   interpret MIDI events, but need only concern themselves
                   with basic functionality. Interpreting the MIDI events is
                   also made easier because each channel is monophonic. To
                   play a chord on the Tandy, for example, each voice must be
                   put in a separate MIDI channel.
       </para></listitem></varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
   </para><para>
   With such a diverse group of devices to support, Sierra put a lot of the
   work on the shoulders of the drivers. Functions for loding patch files,
   handling events, pausing, etc. are all in the drivers. The interpreter
   calls them as needed but does not concern itself at all with how they
   get implemented.
  </para><para>
   Listed here are devices supported by the SCI0 interpreter with a little
   information about each. There could very well be other hardware not listed
   here, so please send in any missing information. Also, since the
   interpreter is made to be device independent, this list could be easily
   expanded. The process would require that a new driver be written and a
   patch file created if appropriate. Since the driver is responsible for
   choosing which patch file to use and then entering it into the device, the
   second step would be quite easy.

   The driver field is the file name of the driver without the drv extension.
   Patch specifies which patch file the driver requests. Poly is the maximum
   number of voices which can be playing at once as reported by the driver.
   The play flag specifies which channels the device will play and gets
   explained in the header section.
  </para>
 </sect2>
 <sect2><Title/File Format/
  <para>
   Sound files follow the same format as all extracted SCI0 resources: the
   first two bytes of the file contain a magic number identifying the
   resource type and the rest of the file contains a dump of the uncompressed
   data. The identifier is the resource type (04h for sound) OR-ed with 80h
   and stored as a word. The result will be 84h 00h in extracted sound files.
 <footnote><para>Please note that FreeSCI's resource_t.data[] stores information
   without the two-byte header.</para></footnote>
  </para><para>  
   The sound resource data itself is a header with channel initialization
   followed by a series of MIDI events.
  </para>
 </sect2>
 <sect2><Title/Header/
  <para>
   The header provides the sound driver with 2 pieces of information about
   each channel. The first is a byte which specifies how many voices each
   logical MIDI channel will be playing. For MIDI synths, this information is
   not really necessary and is probably ignored. The same goes for beepers.
   This byte is only useful for non-MIDI synths which must know how many
   hardware channels each logical MIDI channel will need. This value is only
   an initial setting. Sound files can request changes to the mapping later
   with control changes.
  </para><para>
   It's worth mentioning here that previous revisions of this specification
   said that some of the MIDI controls could be initialized using the first
   byte. I now believe this is a bug in the Adlib driver which happens when
   the value gets too large and causes overflows into other areas of memory.
   There should not be more requested channels than the device has hardware
   channels.
  </para><para>
   The second byte describes how the user's sound harware should treat the
   channel. It is the combination of bit flags which may be OR-ed together.
   If the appropriate bit is set for the currently selected sound device, the
   channel will be played. If it is not, the channel will be silent. The
   driver decides which bit it will use as the play flag, and the table under
   Sound Devices lists the flag used by each driver. Drivers ignore the first
   byte (used to request hardware channels) on MIDI channels it won't play.
  </para><para>
   Before the channel initialization is a byte which specifies whether the
   header holds information for 15 or 16 channels. A value of 0 means that
   there will be 16 channels and a value of 2 means that there will be 15
   channels. All other values are undefined and will render sound files
   unplayable.
  </para><para>
   The header format:
   <simplelist>
      <member/1 byte  - number of channels code (usually 0, can also be 2)/
      <member/2 bytes - initialization for channel 0/
      <member/2 bytes - initialization for channel 1/
      <member/./
      <member/./
      <member/./
      <member/2 bytes - initialization for channel 15/
    </simplelist>
   Notice that the space for channel 15's initialization will always be
   present. If the number of channels code is 2, the last two bytes of the
   header will be ignored, but they are stil in the resource. The header is
   always 33 bytes in length.
  </para>
</sect2><sect2>
 <title/Events/
  <para>
   The actual music is stored in a series of events. The generic form for an
   event is:
  <simplelist>
      <member/&lt;byte - delta time&gt; [byte - status] [byte - p1 [p2]]/
  </simplelist>
  </para><para>
   Delta time is the number of ticks to wait after executing the previous
   event before executing this event. Standard MIDI stores this as a variable
   length value. In sound resources, it will be exactly one byte and the most
   significant bit is in fact used as part of the value. There are 60 ticks
   per second, which is about 16667 microseconds between ticks.
  </para><para>
   The status byte is basically a command. The most significant bit is always
   set. This feature is important because the status byte will not always be
   present. If you read a byte expecting it to be a status byte but the most
   significant bit is not set, that byte is actually a paramater and you
   should repeat the last status used. This is know as running status mode
   and appears to get used relatively often.
  </para><para>
   There generic form for a status byte is (in bits) 1xxxcccc - The lower
   nibble designates which channel the message affects. The upper nibble is
   the command, but as stated earlier, the most significant bit must be 1.
   That leaves space for 8 messages, most of which require at least one
   paramater. Paramaters will never have their most significant bit set.

         </para><para>
            Controls which handle any value are continuous controllers. They
            have a continuous range. Controls which are only on/off are
            switches. Their defined range is only 01h (OFF) and 7Fh (ON).
            However, in order to respond to all values, 01h-3Fh is treated as
            OFF and 40h-7Fh is treated as ON. While in practice they may only
            use bit 6 as a flag, my personal opinion is that values between
            01h and 7Fh should be avoided for the sake of clarity.
         </para><para>
            I used to include a list of common controls with brief summaries
            but now consider it outside the scope of this specification.
            Instead of listing standard MIDI controls, here are some of the
            non-standard controls used by drivers. These will be ignored by
            real MIDI synths but are useful to non-MIDI synths. You should
            know, however, that not all controls are supported in all
            drivers. For that matter, most standard controls are unsupported
            in non-MIDI synths. This was not a problem for Sierra, who could
            package their drivers with the game, but could be a hardship for
            new developers who want to write games for the original
            interpreters. It should not be a problem on new interpreters
            since they can make a more standardized solution to the problem
            playing MIDI files on non-MIDI synths.

    <title/Mapping instruments in FreeSCI/
    <sect2><Title/The Patch.002 resource/
     <para>
       As Ravi describes in his description of the patch resources (which have not been included
       here), one of the major problems with SCI sound support is the lack of General Midi (GM)
       support in the earlier games. Since those were written before GM was conceived, this
       can hardly be considered to be Sierra's fault; but this fact doesn't help when it comes
       to supporting the games in a portable manner.
     </para><para>
       Unfortunately, almost every SCI0 game uses an individual instrument mapping scheme. This
       means that there are only two options to generate GM music from the original SCI sound
       resources: Either create a manual mapping for each game, or abuse existing data from the
       game for this purpose. Obviously, the latter way would be either impossible or much
       easier.
     </para><para>
       So, the solution would be to use an existing instrument mapping scheme. Those mapping schemes
       are stored in the patch resources, and, as such, easily accessible to an SCI engine.
       As those patch files are driver dependant (which, in turn, are hardware dependant), most
       of the patch data is unusable. The Adlib data, for example, will only work for an OPL-2
       FM synthesizer chip or one of its successors, the MT-32 data (which consists of one massive
       sysex block) won't help anyone without an MT-32 or LAPC-1, and so on. So, to recycle
       this hardware-dependant data, two new possibilities remain: Either extract and interpret
       the patch data using a portable software synthesizer (such as timidity), or extract
       instrument names and map those to GM instruments. The first approach would, of course,
       yield the better results (at the cost of computation power); but the only software emulator
       for a specific sound system I've seen so far was an OPL-2 emulator. So the alternative,
       extracting a text ID of each instrument and using it to map this instrument to a GM instrument,
       looks much more promising.
     </para><para>
       Now, most SCI0 games come with a patch.002 resource, which is used by the IBM Music Feature card
       and Yamaha FM-01 sound synthesizers (both of which appear to use frequency modulation).
       This is the only patch file that includes text descriptions of most of its instruments. Note
       this, not all instruments have name representation. This means that some of them can't be
       mapped and have to be silenced; but those instruments are either used for sound effects only
       or not used at all, so this isn't critical.
     </para><para>
       Using those 7-letter instrument names, it is now possible to build a small database of
       instruments, which, subseqently, can be mapped to GM instruments.
     </para><para>
       The file structure is relatively simple (for this purpose): Every patch.002 consists of
       either one or two instrument banks carrying 48 instruments each. Every instrument has a
       fixed block size of 0x40 bytes; each block starts with the 7-letter description of the
       instrument or seven blanks if none is available.
     </para><para>
       If two banks are present, the second bank is separated from the first one by a two-byte
       sequence (0xab, 0xcd). Keeping this in mind, it is trivial to extract the instrument names
       of the 48 or 96 instruments.
     </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2><title/Percussion instruments/
     <para>
       Percussion instruments are treated specially in the MIDI standard. MIDI channel 10 (or 9,
       if you count from 0 to 15 like most people do) is reserved for percussions and some
       special effects; each key for this channel represents either nothing or one
       fixed percussion instrument.
     </para><para>
       At first glance, this might lead to an additional problem of mapping those percussion
       instruments. Fortunately, the General Midi standard extends on the MT-32 percussion mappings,
       which are used in SCI0, so that channel 9 can be left completely untouched in the process
       of instrument mapping.

   <Title/Script resources and the VM/
    <para>
      Like any processor, the SCI virtual machine is useless without code to execute.
      This code is provided by script resources, which constitute the logic behind any
      SCI game.
    </para><para>
      In order to operate on the script resource, those first have to be loaded to the heap.
      The heap is the only memory space that the VM can work on directly (with some restrictions); all
      other memory spaces have to be used implicitly or explicitly by using kernel calls.
      The heap also contains a stack, which is heavily used by SCI bytecode.
    </para><para>
      Each script resource may contain one or several of various script objects, listed
      here<footnote><para/Other types are used as well, but they are addressed directly by the
      SCI bytecode, so their meaning has not been thoroughly investigated yet/</footnote>:
      <simplelist>
       <member/Type 1: Object/
       <member/Type 2: Code/
       <member/Type 5: Strings/
       <member/Type 6: Class/
       <member/Type 7: Exports/
       <member/Type 8: Pointers/
       <member/Type 10: Local variables/
      </simplelist>
      </para><para>
       The code blocks contain the SCI bytecode that actually gets executed. The export block
       (of which there may be only one (or none at all)) contains script-relative pointers to
       exported functions, which can be called by the SCI operations <function/calle/ and
       <function/callb/. The local variables block, which stores one of the four variable types,
       is used to share variables among the objects and classes of one script.
      </para><para>
       But the most important script members are Objects and Classes. As in the usual OOP terms,
       Classes refer to object prototypes, and Objects are instantiated Classes. However, unlike
       most OOP languages, SCI treats the base class very similar to objects, so that they may
       actually get called by the SCI bytecode. Therefore, they also have their own space for
       selectors (see below). Also, each object or class knows which class it inherits from and
       which class it was instantiated from (in the case of objects).
    </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
   <Title/Selectors/
    <para>
       Selectors are very important in SCI. They can be either methods or object/class-relative
       variables, and this makes the interpretation of SCI operations like <function/send/
       a bit tricky.
    </para><para>
       Each class comes with two two-dimensional tables. The first table contains selector values
       and selector indices<footnote><para>Those can be used as an index into vocab.997, where
       the selector names are stored as strings.</para></footnote> for each variable selector. The
       second table contains selector indices and script-relative method offsets. Objects look
       nearly identical, but they do not contain the list of selector indices for variable selectors,
       since those can be looked up at the class they were instantiated from (their "species", which
       happens to be one of the variable selectors).
    </para><para>
       Now, whenever a selector is sent for, the engine has to determine the right action to take.
       FreeSCI first determines whether the selector is a variable selector, by looking for it in
       the list of variable selector indices of the species class of the object that the
       "<function/send/" was sent to (classes use their own class number as their species class)
       <footnote><para/In practice, send looks up the heap position of the requested class in a
       global class table./</footnote>. If it is, the selector value is either read (if no parameter
       was provided to the <function/send/ call) or set (if one parameter was provided). If the
       selector was not part of the variable selectors of the specified object, the object's methods
       are checked for this selector index. If they don't contain the selector index, either, then
       FreeSCI recurses into checking the method selectors of the object's superclasses. If it finds
       the selector value there, it calls the heap address corresponding to the selector index.
    </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2>
   <Title/Function invocation/
    <para>
       SCI provides three distinct ways for invocating a function<footnote><para/Of course, "manual"
       invocation (using push and jump operations) could also be used, but there are no special
       provisions for it, and it does not appear to be used in the existing SCI bytecode./</footnote>:
       <simplelist>
        <member>Calling exported functions (<function/calle/, <function/callb/)</member>
        <member>Calling selector methods (<function/send/, <function/self/, <function/super/)</member>
        <member>Calling PC-relative addresses (<function/call/)</member>
       </simplelist>
    </para><para>
       Exported functions are called by providing a script number and an exported function number
       (which is then looked up in the script's Type 7 block). They use the object they were called
       from to look up local variables and selectors for <function/self/ and <function/super/.
     </para><para>
       Selector methods are called by providing an object and a selector index. The selector index
       gets looked up in the object's selector tables, and, if it is used for a method, this method
       gets invocated. The provided object is used for local references.
     </para><para>
       PC-relative calls only make sense inside scripts, since they jump to a position relative
       to the <function/call/ opcode. The calling object is used for local references.

              Those variables are stored on the stack. They are relative to the stack frame of

              This is commonly done by using the <function/link/ operation.

  <title/Interpreter initialization and the main execution loop/
  <para>
By <author><firstname/Lars/<surname/Skovlund/</author>
Version 1.0, 7. July 1999
</para><para>
When the interpreter initializes, it sets up a timer for 60 hertz (one that
"ticks" 60 times per second). This timer does two things: it lets
the so-called servers execute (most notably, the sound player and input
manager) and it "feeds" the internal game clock. This 60 hz. "systick" is
used all over the place. For example, it is accessible using the KGetTime
kernel function. Some graphic effects depend on it, for example the
"shake screen" effect. In SCI1, it is also used for timing in the palette
fades. And naturally, it is used in the KWait kernel call.
</para><para>
Basically, the initialization proceeds as follows:
<simplelist>
<member/   Initialize the heap and hunk./
<member/   Parse the config file and the command line./
<member/   Load the drivers specified in the config file/
<member/   Initialize the graphics subsystem./
<member/   Initialize the event manager/
<member/   Initialize the window manager/
<member/   Initialize the text parser (i.e. load the vocabulary files)/
<member/   Initialize the music player/
<member>   Save the machine state for restarting the game later on
  <footnote><para>This is quite interesting, the KRestartGame kernel call is implemented
  using a simple setjmp/longjmp pair.</para></footnote></member>
<member/   Allocate the PMachine stack on the heap./
<member/   Get a pointer to the game object/
<member/   And run, by executing the play or replay method./
</simplelist>
</para><para>
The right game object is found by looking in the "dispatch table" of script
0. The dispatch table has block type 7, and is an array of words. The first
entry is a pointer (script relative) to the game object, for instance SQ3.
If the game was restarted, the interpreter executes the replay method, play
otherwise.
</para><para>
After looking up the address of the method in the object block, execution is
started. It can be viewed as a huge switch statement, which executes con-
tinuously. When the last ret statement (in the play or replay method) is
met, the interpreter terminates.
</para><para>
The ExecuteCode function, which contains the mentioned switch statement,
is called recursively. It lets other subroutines handle the object
complexity, all the ExecuteCode function has is a pointer to the next in-
struction. Thus, it is easy to terminate the interpreter; just return from
all running instances of ExecuteCode.
</para><para>
So, how does an SCI program execute? Well, the play method is defined in the
Game class, and it is never overridden. It consists of a huge loop which
calls Game::doit continuously, followed by a pause according to the selected
animation speed. That is, the script, not the interpreter, handles animation
speed. Notice how the debugger very often shows the statement sag $12 upon
entering the debugger? This instruction resides in Game::play, and the break
occurs here because of a KWait kernel call which is executed right before
that instruction. This wait takes the most execution time, so therefore the
debug break is most likely to be
A game programmer would then override Game::doit and place the game
specific main loop here (still, Game::doit is almost identical from game to
game). Execution of the Game::play main loop stops when an event causes
global variable 4 to be non-zero. The last ret instruction is met, and the
interpreter terminates.

   <Title/The SCI Heap/
    <para>
     SCI0 (and probably SCI1 as well) uses a heap consisting of 0xffff bytes of
     memory; this size corresponds to the size of one i386 real-mode memory segment
     minus one.
     <Footnote><para/
     This appears to be the maximum size; the games generally require less heap
     space./
     </Footnote>
    </para>

     <sect2>
     <Title/Heap structure/
     <para>
      The original heap starts with 200 separate entries with a size of four bytes.
      Each of those entries appears to be a pointer to "hunk" memory, which is
      separate from the heap and not covered here. The actual heap base pointer
      points to the first byte that is not part of these pointers.
     </para>
     </sect2>

     <sect2>
      <Title/Memory handles/
      <para>
      A memory handle consists of two consecutive unsigned 16 bit integers:
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem><para>The memory block size</para></listitem>
       <listitem><para>The heap address of the next memory handle</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      in this sequence.
      </para><para>
      Memory handles are stored inside of the heap; they delimit the holes in the
      heap by indexing each other, with the exception of the last handle, which
      points to zero.
     </para>
     </sect2>


     <sect2>
     <Title/Initialization/
     <para>
      The list is initialized to 0. Memory handle #0 is set to contain 0xffff minus
      the size required by the memory handles (800 bytes) to a total of 0xfcdf,
      the pointer to the next free index is set to 0x0.
     </para>
     </sect2>

     <sect2>
     <Title/Memory allocation/
     <para>
      The memory allocation function takes one parameter; this is the requested allocation
      block size. If it is 0, the function aborts. Otherwise, the size is increased by 2
      (and then again by 1, if it is odd, for alignment purposes).
     </para><para>
      After the memory allocation algorithm finds a sufficiently large memory hole, it
      allocates its memory by splitting the memory hole and allocating the lower part
      (or by swallowing the upper part if its size would be less than four). It adjusts the
      previous memory handle (which used to point to the start of the now allocated part
      of the heap) to point to the next hole, and then goes on to write its size to the first
      two bytes of its newly allocated home.
     </para><para>
      If no sufficiently large memory hole can be found, the function returns 0; otherwise,
      it returns a heap pointer to the start of the allocated block (i.e. to the two bytes
      that carry the block's size).
     </para>
     <para>
      Memory deallocation does this process in reverse; it also merges adjacent memory holes
      to prevent memory fragmentation.

    </para><para/Version 1.0, 12. July 1999/
<para>
This article will deal with the event manager in SCI. Like several other
key parts of the interpreter, this one actively communicates with the SCI
application. It directly writes to objects of the Event class, but more on
that later.
</para><para>
The different input devices are polled differently:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The keyboard is typically polled at each timer tick (which is 60 hz).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>SCI sets up a callback for the PC mouse driver, meaning that
the mouse driver "polls itself" and sends information to the interpreter.
On non-MS-DOS platforms, this would probably be done in the timer handler.
<footnote><para>The default FreeSCI event mechanism uses libgii, which is completely
event-based.</para></footnote></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The joystick is only polled when the script wants to.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para><para>
Some parts of the event mechanism (in particular, keyboard management) are
very PC specific, and a conversion will no doubt have to take place on other
platforms.
</para>
 <sect2>
  <title/Event types and modifiers/
   <para>
There are three types of events, distinguished by their "type" property.
The possible values are listed below; they are laid out as a bitfield to
allow for selective event retrieval, see later.
<simplelist>
  <member/0 - Null event/
  <member/1 - Mouse button event/
  <member/2 - Mouse button release event/
  <member/4 - Keyboard event/
  <member/64 - Movement (joystick) event/
</simplelist>
</para><para>
This type is returned to the SCI event managers by the input device drivers
along with a "message" and a set of "modifiers". This is the basic event
structure, although some event types contain extra information. The latter
field is a direct copy of the BIOS shift flags, laid out as follows:
</para><para>
<simplelist>
<member/bit 7 - Insert active/
<member/bit 6 - Caps lock active/
<member/bit 5 - Num lock active/
<member/bit 4 - Scroll lock active/
<member/bit 3 - Alt key pressed/
<member/bit 2 - Ctrl key pressed/
<member/bit 1 - Left shift key pressed/
<member/bit 0 - Right shift key pressed/
</simplelist>
</para><para>
It is obvious, then, that these keys by themselves don't generate any
keyboard events. They can, however, be combined with other keys or mouse
clicks to produce "shift-click" events, for instance.
</para>
<sect3><title/The null events/
<para>
These are generated when a script wants to see an event, but there isn't one
to give. The current tick count and mouse position. The tick count, as 
explained in
another document, is the time passed since the interpreter started, measured
in 1/60ths of a second. It doesn't seem to be copied into the event object,
however.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
 <title/The mouse events/
<para>
The mouse position is returned in extra fields in the event record.
</para><para>
If the middle or right button is pressed, this is reflected by the 
modifiers,
in addition to the mouse event. The middle button is translated to the Ctrl
key (i.e. set modifiers bit 2), the right button "holds down" both shift 
keys
(setting bits 1 and 0). Every SCI interpreter (at least from 0.000.572 and
up) does this, but to my knowledge it is used only in QfG2, where either
a shift-click or a right-click is equivalent to typing "look ...".
</para></sect3>

<sect3><title/The keyboard event/
<para>
The keyboard driver also generates events. When a key is pressed, a keyboard
event is generated, with the message field set to the scan code of the
pressed key. It should be simple enough, right? Not quite so. The script may
want to know if a direction key was pressed, and if so, which. It may call
the KMapKeyToDir kernel function for this. KMapKeyToDir takes a keyboard
event as input and converts it to a movement event, which is described next.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title/The movement event/
<para>
The movement event is only generated by the joystick driver. However, on
request, the keyboard driver can convert keyboard events into movement 
events
as described above. The message field is just a direction code, mapped as
follows:
<informaltable frame="all">

That is, the direction code starts at straight up (code 1), increasing
with clockwise movement.

         Version 1.0, 6. July 1999 </para>
      <para>
This document describes thee design of the Sierra PMachine (the virtual CPU
used for executing SCI programs). It is a special CPU, in the sense that it
is designed for object oriented programs.
</para><para>
There are three kinds of memory in SCI: Variables, objects, and stack space.
The stack space is used in a Last-In-First-Out manner, and is primarily used
for temporary space in a routine, as well as passing data from one routine
to another. Note that the stack space is used bottom-up by the original in-
terpreter, instead of the more usual top-down. I don't know if this has any
significance for us.
</para><para>
Scripts are loaded into the PMachine by creating a memory imagee of it on 
the
heap. For this reason, the script file format may seem a bit obscure at
times. It is optimized for in-memory performance, not readability. It should
be mentioned here that a lot of fixup stuff is done by the interpreter.
In the script files, all addresses are specified as script-relative. These
are converted to absolute offsets. The species and superClass fields of all
objects are converted into pointers to the actual class etc.
</para><para>
There are four types of variables. These are called global, local, 
temporary,
and parameter. All four types are simple arrays of 16-bit words. A pointer 
is
kept for each type, pointing to the list that is currently active. In fact,
only the global variable list is constant in memory. The other pointers are
changed frequently, as scripts are loaded/unloaded, routines called, etc.
The variables are always referenced as an index into the variable list.
I'll explain the four types below - the names in parantheses will be used
occasionally in the rest of the text:
</para>
<sect2><Title/Local variables (LocalVar)/
<para>
This variable type is called "local" because it belongs to a specific 
script.
Each script may have its own set of local variables, defined by script block
type 10. As long as the code from a specific script is running, the local
variables for that script are "active" (pointed to by the mentioned 
pointer).
</para></sect2>
<sect2><Title/Global variables/
<para>
These, like the local variables, reside in script space (in fact, they are
the local variables of script 0!). But the pointer to them remains constant
for the whole duration of the program.
</para></sect2>
<sect2><Title/Temporary variables/
<para>
These are allocated by specific subroutines in a script. They reside on the
PMachine stack and are allocated by the link opcode. The temp variables are
automatically discarded when the subroutine returns.
</para></sect2>
<sect2><Title/Parameter variables/
<para>
These variables also reside on the stack. They contain information passed
from one routine to another. Any routine in SCI is capable of taking a
variable number of parameters, if need be. This is possible because a list
size is pushed as the first thing before calling a routine. In addition to
this, a frame size is passed to the call* functions.
</para></sect2>
<sect2><Title/Objects/
<para>
While two adjacent variables may be entirely unrelated, the contents of an
object is always related to one task. The object, like the variable tables,
provides storage space. This storage space is called properties. Depending
on the instructions used, a property can be referred to by index into the
object structure, or by property IDs (PIDs). For instance, the name property
has the PID 17h, but the offset 6. The property IDs are assigned by the SCI
compiler, and it is the "compatible" way of accessing object data. Whereas
the offset method is used only internally by an object to access its own
data, the PID method is used externally by objects to read/write the data
fields of other objects. The PID method is also used to call methods in an
object, either by the object itself, by another object, or by the SCI inter-
preter. Yes, this really happens sometimes.
</para></sect2>
<sect2><Title/The PMachine "registers"/
<para>
The PMachine can be said to have a number of registers, although none of 
them
can be accessed explicitly by script code. They are used/changed implicitly
by the script opcodes:
<simplelist>
  <member/Acc - the accumulator. Used for result storage and input for a number of
  opcodes./
  <member>IP - the instruction pointer.<Footnote><para/FreeSCI calls this the "Program Counter"
          or PC, which is the more general term./</footnote>
          Points to the currently executing instruction</member>
  <member/Vars - an array of 4 values, pointing to the current variables of each
  mentioned type/
  <member/Object - points to the currently executing object./
  <member/SP - the current stack pointer. Note that the stack in the original SCI
  interpreter is used bottom-up instead of the more usual top-down./
</simplelist>
</para><para>
The PMachine, apart from the actual instruction pointer, keeps a record of
which object is currently executing.
</para></sect2>
<sect2><title/The instruction set/
<para>
The PMachine CPU potentially has 128 instructions (however, a couple of 
these
are invalid and generate an error). Some of these instructions have a flag
which specify whether the opcode has byte- or word-sized operands (I will
refer to this as variably-sized parameters, as opposed to constant
parameters). Other instructions have only one calling form. These
instructions simply disregard the operand size flag. Ideally, however, all
script instructions should be prepared to take variably-sized operands.
Yet another group of instructions take both a constant parameter and a
variably-sized parameter. The format of an opcode byte is as follows:
<informaltable frame="all">
 <tgroup cols="2">
  <tbody>
   <row>
    <entry/bit 7-1/<entry/        opcode number/
   </row><row>
    <entry/bit 0/<entry/            operand size flag/
   </row>
  </tbody>
 </tgroup>
</informaltable>
</para>
<sect3><title/Relative addresses/
<para>
Certain instructions (in particular, branching ones) take relative addresses
as a parameter. The actual address is calculated based on the instruction
after the branching instruction itself. In this example, the bnt
instruction, if the branch is made, jumps over the ldi instruction.
<programlisting>
        eq?
        bnt +2
        ldi byte 2
        push
</programlisting>
<note><para/Relative addresses are signed values./</note>
</para></sect3>
<sect3><title/Dispatch addresses/
<para>
The callb and calle instructions take a so-called dispatch index as a
parameter. This index is used to look up an actual script address, using the
so-called dispatch table. The dispatch table is located in script block type
7 in the script file. It is a series of words - the first one, as in so many
other places in the script file, is the number of entries.
</para></sect3>
<sect3><title/Frame sizes/
<para>
In every call instruction, a value is included which determines the size of
the parameter list, as an offset into the stack. This value discounts the
list size pushed by the SCI code. For instance, consider this example from
real SCI code:

<programlisting>
     pushi 3 ; three parameters passed
     pushi 4 ; the screen flag
     pTos x ; push the x property
     pTos y ; push the y property
     callk OnControl, 6
</programlisting>

Notice that, although the callk line specifies 6 bytes of parameters, the
kernel routine has access to the list size (which is at offset 8)!
</para></sect3>
<sect3><title/PErrors/
<para>
These are internal errors in the interpreter. They are usually caused by
buggy script code. The PErrors end up displaying an "Oops!" box in the
original interpreter (it is interesting to see how Sierra likes to believe
that PErrors are caused by the user - judging by the message "You did
something we weren't expecting"!). In the original interpreter, specifying
-d on the command line causes it to give more detailed information about
PErrors, as well as activating the internal debugger if one occurs.
</para></sect3>
<sect3><Title/Class numbers and adresses/
<para>
The key to finding a specific class lies in the class table. This class
table resides in VOCAB.996, and contains the numbers of scripts that carry
classes. If a script has more than one class defintion, the script number
is repeated as necessary. Notice how each script number is followed by a
zero word? When the interpreter loads a script, it checks to see if the
script has classes. If it does, a pointer to the object structure is put in
this empty space.
</para></sect3>
<sect3><title/The instructions/
<para>
The instructions are described below. I have used Dark Minister's text on
the subject as a starting point, but many things have changed; stuff
explained more thoroughly, errors corrected, etc. The first 23 instructions
(up to, but not including, bt) take no parameters.
      </para><para>
         These functions are used in the pseudocode explanations:
         <simplelist>
           <member/pop(): sp -= 2; return *sp;/
           <member/push(x): *sp = x; sp += 2; return x;/
         </simplelist>
         The following rules apply to opcodes:
         <simplelist>
           <member/Parameters are signed, unless stated otherwise. Sign extension is performed./
           <member/Jumps are relative to the posisition of the next operation./
           <member/*TOS refers to the TOS (Top Of Stack) element./
           <member/"tmp" refers to a temporary register that is used for explanation purposes only./
         </simplelist>
      </para>

              Send for one or more selectors. This is the most complex SCI operation (together with
              self and class).
            </para><para>
              Send looks up the supplied selector(s) in the object pointed to by the accumulator.
              If the selector is a variable selector, it is read (to the accumulator) if it was sent
              for with zero parameters. If a parameter was supplied, this selector is set to that
              parameter. Method selectors are called with the specified parameters.
            </para><para>
              The selector(s) and parameters are retreived from the stack frame. Send first looks up
              the selector ID at the bottom of the frame, then retreives the number of parameters,
              and, eventually, the parameters themselves. This algorithm is iterated until all of
              the stack frame has been "used up". Example:
            <programlisting/; This is an example for usage of the SCI send operation
                            pushi x      ; push the selector ID of x
                            push1        ; 1 parameter: x is supposed to be set
                            pushi 42     ; That's the value x will get set to
                            pushi moveTo ; In this example, moveTo is a method selector.
                            push2        ; It will get called with two parameters-
                            push         ; The accumulator...
                            lofss 17     ; ...and PC-relative address 17.
                            pushi foo    ; Let's assume that foo is another variable selector.
                            push0        ; This will read foo and return the value in acc.
                            send 12      ; This operation does three quite different things./

    Pushes all or part of the ParmVar list on the stack. The number specifies
    the first parameter variable to be pushed.
    I'll give a small example. Suppose we have two functions:
</para><para>
    function a(y,z)
    and
    function b(x,y,z)
</para><para>
    function b wants to call function a with its own y and z parameters. Easy
    job, using the the normal lsp instruction. Now suppose that both function
    a and b are designed to take a variable number of parameters:
</para><para>
    function a(y,z,...)
    and
    function b(x,y,z,...)
</para><para>
    Since lsp does not support register indirection, we can't just push the
    variables in a loop (as we would in C). Instead this function is used.
    In this case, the instruction would be &amp;rest 2, since we want the copying
    to start from y, the second parameter.

              The remaining SCI operations work on one of the four variable types. The variable
              index is retreived by taking the heap pointer for the specified variable type, adding
              the <parameter/index/ and possibly the accumulator, and executing the operation according

In SCI0, calls to the SCI kernel are initiated by using the <function>callk</function> opcode.
<function>callk</function> has the opcode <literal>0x42</literal>
or <literal>0x43</literal>; <literal>0x42</literal> takes one 16 bit little endian and
one 8 bit paramter, <literal/0x43/ takes two 8 bit parameters.
The first parameter is the number of the kernel function to be called, the
second number undetermined (as of yet).
</para><para>
Opcode summary:
</para><para>
<simplelist>
<member>op 0x42: callk W kfunct, B kparams  (4 bytes)</member>
<member>op 0x43: callk B kfunct, B kparams  (3 bytes)</member>
</simplelist>
</para><para>
The number of parameters passed to the kernel function are determined
by kparam. A total number of (kparams+2) bytes are removed from the local
stack and passed on to the kernel function.
The first two of those bytes are apparently always created by pushing
the number of following bytes.
For example, if Load(view, 10) is called, then we've got two word
parameters, "view" (0x0080) and "10" (0x000a). So the callk function would
have kparams set to 4; this value would be pushed to the stack first,
followed by the two parameters.
So the stack would look like this (left means lower address, byte ordering
little endian):

Return values are returned into the accumulator, unless stated otherwise.
If return type is stated as (void), then the accumulator is not modified.

SCI0 uses only little endian 16 bit integer values for parameters. However, this document
distinguishes between different uses of those integers by defining the following variable
types:
<simplelist>
<member><Type/(word)/: 16 bit signed little endian integer</member>
<member><Type/(HeapPtr)/: As <Type/(word)/; interpreted as a pointer to a heap address</member>
<member><Type/(DblList)/: As <Type/(HeapPtr)/; interpreted as offset of a doubly linked list</member>
<member><Type/(&amp;FarPtr)/: As <Type/(HeapPtr)/; interpreted as the 32 bit pointer stored at
           the referenced heap address</member>
<member><Type/(Point)/: A sequence of two <Type/(word)/s to describe a point on the screen, with
the y coordinate being the first in the sequence.</member>
<member><Type/(Rect)/: A sequence of four <Type/(word)/s describing a rectangle. If you read
"(Rect) foo", think "(word) foo_ymin, (word) foo_xmin, (word) foo_ymax, (word) foo_xmax" instead.
</member>
</simplelist>
</para><para>
Parameters in brackets (like "[foo]") are optional.

Most functions exit gracefully if either a NULL HeapPtr or DblList is
provided.

The second parameter does not appear to affect anything. In QfG1, it appears
to be set to 0x64 constantly.
DefaultPalette is used to differentiate between day and night in QfG1. Palette
1 is used for "night" pictures, Palette 0 for "day" pictures there.
The picture is drawn to the background image (which is used for restauration of
everything with the exception of the mouse pointer). To bring it to the
foreground, Animate() must be used.

This function draws a background picture plus some views to the foreground.
If the first parameter is 0 or not present, it does not add any views; other-
wise, it does add them (they probably are some kind of doubly linked list).
The purpose of the second parameter is unknown, as it does not seem to affect
anything.
This method does allow for special effects while transferring a picture; the
"how" remains a mystery, though.
