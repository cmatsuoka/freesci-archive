I have a partial format for the Adlib patch resources if you feel like
playing around with them. The information isn't verified correct, so when
stuff goes wrong trust your own results over whatever I write here:

Each instrument definition is 28 bytes long consisting of two 14 byte
structures. The structures hold Adlib register information for the two
Adlib operators which make up the instrument.

0000 keyScaling      db ?   ; 0 - 3
0001 freqMod         db ?   ; 0 - 15
0002 feedback        db ?   ; 0 - 7
0003 attackRate      db ?   ; 0 - 15
0004 sustainVol      db ?   ; 0 - 15
0005 envelope        db ?   ; true, false
0006 decayRate       db ?   ; 0 - 15
0007 releaseRate     db ?   ; 0 - 15
0008 volume          db ?   ; 0 - 63
0009 ampMod          db ?   ; true, false
000A vibrato         db ?   ; true, false
000B kybdScaling     db ?   ; true, false
000C algorithm       db ?   ; 0, 1
000D waveform        db ?   ; 0 - 3

Some of the fields, like algorithm, are only relevant in one of the
operator structures. I think these fields contain other data in the other
operator structure, but I don't know what they hold.

Cheers,
Ravi.
