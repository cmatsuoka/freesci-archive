1    Building FreeSCI
---------------------

Building is done from within a UNIX environment (e.g. Linux or Cygwin).

You will need the following:

- Dreamcast toolchain builder 0.1. Available from
  http://freesci.org/?page=dreamcast.

Follow the enclosed instructions to set up the toolchain. Afterwards FreeSCI
can be built by doing the following:

1) Execute your KOS environ script.
2) Change to the src/dc directory of the FreeSCI distribution.
3) Run `make'.

This should result in a `freesci.bin' binary in the src/dc directory.


2    Loading FreeSCI
--------------------

There are basically 3 ways to execute the FreeSCI binary on the Dreamcast.
Loading the binary over a serial link, loading the binary over a network
link or burning the executable on a CD-R.

2.1  Loading over a serial link
-------------------------------

You will need:

- A PC to Dreamcast serial cable.
- dcload-serial. Available from
  http://adk.napalm-x.com/dc/dcload-serial/index.html.

1) Insert the dcload CD in your Dreamcast and turn it on. Wait for the
   dcload utility to start.
2) Run `dc-tool -x freesci.bin'. You may need additional parameters to
   change the baud rate and/or serial port that is used.

2.2  Loading over a network link
--------------------------------

You will need:

- A Dreamcast Broadband/LAN adapter to connect the Dreamcast to your PC.
- dcload-ip. Available from http://adk.napalm-x.com/dc/dcload-ip/index.html.

1) Insert the dcload CD in your Dreamcast and turn it on. Wait for the
   dcload utility to start.
2) Run `dc-tool -x freesci.bin'. You may need additional parameters to
   indicate the Dreamcast's ip address.

2.3  Loading from a CD-R
------------------------

Burning the binary on a CD-R can be done in several ways. The method that's
described here is only one of those ways and only works in a UNIX environment.
This paragraph is based on a tutorial from Marcus Comstedt's website. If you
need more detailed info, have a look at http://mc.pp.se/dc/.

You will need:

- 1ST_READ.BIN scrambler. Available from http://mc.pp.se/dc/sw.html.
- IP creator. Available from http://mc.pp.se/dc/sw.html.
- cdrtools. Available from http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/
  employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html

1) Run `cdrecord -scanbus' and remember the SCSI id of your CD recorder. The
   remainder of this paragraph will assume a SCSI id of `0,0,0'. You should
   substitute the actual id of your CD recorder for `0,0,0'.
2) Create a 4 second audio track: `dd if=/dev/zero bs=2352 count=300
   of=audio.raw'.
3) Burn this track to a CD with cdrecord: `cdrecord dev=0,0,0 -multi -audio
   audio.raw'.
4) Run `cdrecord dev=0,0,0 -msinfo'. Remember the offset it returns. The
   remainder of this paragraph will assume an offset of `0,11700'. You should
   substitute the actual offset returned by cdrecord for `0,11700'.
5) Use the 1ST_READ.BIN scrambler to scramble the freesci binary and create
   a `1ST_READ.BIN' file: `scramble freesci.bin 1ST_READ.BIN'.
6) Create an ISO image of `1ST_READ.BIN': `mkisofs -l -C 0,11700 -o
   freesci.iso 1ST_READ.BIN'. *
7) Use the IP Creator to create an `IP.BIN' file: `makeip ip.txt IP.BIN'.
8) Dump this `IP.BIN' bootstrap into the ISO image: `( cat IP.BIN ; dd
   if=freesci.iso bs=2048 skip=16 ) > data.raw'.
9) Record the data track to the CD: `cdrecord dev=0,0,0 -xa data.raw'

You should now have a selfbooting FreeSCI CD, just put it in your Dreamcast
and turn it on.

* If you also want to put games on this CD you should use the following
  procedure instead:

  1) Create a new directory somewhere on your harddisk. The remainder of
     this paragraph assumes that it's called `newdir'. You should substitute
     the actual directory you created for `newdir'.
  2) Copy 1ST_READ.BIN to `newdir'.
  3) Copy all the games into separate subdirectories under `newdir'. You can
     put those subdirectories anywhere you want, e.g. directly under `newdir'
     or under another subdirectory called `GAMES'.
  4) Create an ISO image of this directory structure: `mkisofs -l -C 0,11700
     -o freesci.iso newdir'.


3    Game CDs
-------------

FreeSCI supports almost any Mode 1 data CD containing SCI games, there are no
requirements on directory layout. As a result of this, you can run games
directly from Sierra collection CDs.

3.1  Making a game CD
---------------------

You might want to create your own compilation of SCI games and burn it on a
CD. Each game should have it's own subdirectory. Other than that, you can
use any directory layout you like. The game CDs should be Mode 1 data CDs.


4    Loading an SCI game
------------------------

The FreeSCI game menu interface can only be used with a controller. After you
have loaded FreeSCI, it will wait for a CD to be inserted. After you insert
a CD it will be scanned for SCI games, which may take a while depending on the
number of files on the CD. You will be presented with a list of directories
containing an SCI game. Please note that this list could also contain games
which are currently not compatible with FreeSCI. Please refer to
http://freesci.org for more info on which games should work and which won't.

Use the directional pad to move the selection bar to the game you want to
play. The R and L shoulder buttons can be used to move immediately to the
next or previous page respectively, which might be useful if there are many
games on the CD. Push the `A' button to start the currently selected game.


5   Configuration options
-------------------------

If you press B in the game menu interface you will be presented with a list
of config options. Please check the README file for more information. Press A
to change the options and press B to go back to the game list.

Video Mode - Sets the `render_mode' option of the Dreamcast graphics driver.
Letterboxed = vram
Full-Screen = pvr

Dithering - Sets the `pic0_dither_mode' option.
256 Color Dithering = dither256
Interpolate = flat
16 Color Dithering = dither

Antialiasing - Sets the `pic_antialiasing' option.
Off - none
On - simple

SCI Version - Sets the `version' option.

Resource Version - Sets the `resource_version' option.

Pic Port Bounds - Sets the `pic_port_bounds' option.


6    Controls
-------------

FreeSCI supports keyboard and mouse. A keyboard is highly recommended.
However it's also possible to use only the controller:

Directional pad - Cursor keys
B button - Enter
X button - Space
Y button - Escape
L trigger - Left mouse button
R trigger - Right mouse button
Start - Toggle virtual keyboard

While the virtual keyboard is active, the controls are as follows:

Directional pad - Move cursor
A - Press currently selected key

The key marked `Fn' will switch the keyboard to a second layout with
additional keys.


7    Known issues
-----------------

This section lists a number of known issues related specifically to the
Dreamcast port.

7.1  FreeSCI config file
------------------------

The FreeSCI config file that is used on other platforms is currently not
supported on Dreamcast. The only options that can be changed are those
presented by the startup menu (see section 5).

7.2  Mad Catz Keyboard Adapter
------------------------------

The Mad Catz Keyboard Adapter is currently not supported. The reason why it
isn't working right is currently unknown. This issue is being investigated.


8    Acknowledgments
--------------------

Thanks to Dan Potter for creating KOS, the development kit used to port
FreeSCI to the Dreamcast.

Thanks to Bruce Philip for trying out several FreeSCI binaries and keyboard
test programs to help me figure out what the problem is with the Mad Catz
Keyboard Adapter.
