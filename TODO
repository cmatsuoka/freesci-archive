TODO for 0.3.1:

- Implement sound servers that actually make some sound
- Merge Magnus' Python class browser into the main tree

GFX subsystem:

- pic_0.c: Fix artifact removal to check surrounding pixels for occurences of
	white before removing a white pixel
- pic_0.c: Add SCI1 support (priority palettes and embedded views)
- pal_1.c: Fix palettes not to compress colors (doing this is pointless and wrong)
- operations.c: Remove the scroll offset (it's obsolete now)
- operations.c: Add full support for state->visible_map
- operations.c and operations.h: Add support for OnControl()
- resmgr.c: Remove allocated picviews (all views requested in between get-pic and the
	first update, but not re-requested during the second series of requests)
- widgets.c: Add correct support for widget->ID variables during gfxw_add(), using
	generic comparison/merge functions
