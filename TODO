TODO for 0.3.3:

Primary goals:
	* Fix DoAvoider
	* Fix DoBresen in the CB1 intros
	* Add LRU resource manager
	* Add graphical config file manager
	* Add PCM output support and one driver to use it
	* Add implicit note-offs dependant on the MIDI file's max number of
	  notes

Secondary goals:
	+ Re-implement on-screen console
	+ operations.c: Add full support for state->visible_map
	+ optimize pic drawing
	+ Add graphical game selection screen
	* fix invalid (but consistent) shifting for word classes
	  (is w[0] << 4 | (w[1] & 0xf0) >> 4, but should be w[0] | w[1] << 4).
	* docs: Mention words with class set to zero (no word).

Bonus goals:
	+ grammar.c: Replace proto-Earley parser with backtracking Earley
	* Add glx graphics driver
	* pic_0.c: Add SCI01 support (priority palettes and embedded views)
	* pal_1.c: Fix palettes not to compress colors (doing this is pointless
	  and wrong)


*: Normal goal
+: If not met for 0.3.3, the goal will rise up one class
