TODO for 0.6.2:

Primary goals:
 * Fix realtime song player detection of situations in which too much
   time has passed
 * Remove all remaining uses of 'scripttable', including the ones that
   refer to synonyms

Secondary goals:

 * if scaled images are turned off, drawing SCI1 (pixmap) backgrounds
   is completely broken for scaled (-x2 etc.) sizes. Fix this!
 * Status bar: When removed, recover background (as opposed to just
   drawing black)-- fixes Jones16 menu bar

Bonus goals:


*: Normal goal
+: If not met for 0.6.2, the goal will rise up one class
