TODO for version 0.2.3:

- Merge Magnus' Python class browser into the main tree
- Use 'gamestate_t' everywhere to store the game state
- Add a (dis)assembler/debugger tool for the command line
- Fix MIDI mapping to remove unmapped instruments, add remaining ones
  to the instrument list, allow in-game editing of instrument lists, and
  use doc/misc/pq2map.txt to improve the current maps.
