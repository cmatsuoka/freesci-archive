TODO for 0.3.2:

Note: Yes, somehow that's almost the same as the TODO for 0.3.1.
We'll take it more seriously next time, I hope.

- Implement sound servers that actually make some sound
- Merge Magnus' Python class browser into the main tree
- docs: Update grammar section to mention 0x400 (special words) and add the
  missing said() rule
- fix invalid (but consistent) shifting for word classes (is w[0] << 4 | (w[1] & 0xf0) >> 4, but should be w[0] | w[1] << 4).
- docs: Mention words with class set to zero (no word).
- docs: Mention special semantics of the "anyword" (0xfff)


GFX subsystem:

- pic_0.c: Fix artifact removal to check surrounding pixels for occurences of
	white before removing a white pixel
- pic_0.c: Add SCI01 support (priority palettes and embedded views)
- pal_1.c: Fix palettes not to compress colors (doing this is pointless and wrong)
- operations.c: Remove the scroll offset (it's obsolete now)
- operations.c: Add full support for state->visible_map
