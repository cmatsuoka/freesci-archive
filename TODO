TODO for 0.3.2:

Primary goals:
	* Win32 port
	* Implement sound servers that actually make some sound

Secondary goals:
	+ Fix DoAvoider
	+ Fix DoBresen in the HQ and CB1 intros
	+ Refactor resource.h and move the portability stuff into a different
	  header file
	+ Add any gfx driver of the following: glx, Xlib, SDL
	* LRU resource manager
	* fix invalid (but consistent) shifting for word classes
	  (is w[0] << 4 | (w[1] & 0xf0) >> 4, but should be w[0] | w[1] << 4).
	* docs: Mention words with class set to zero (no word).
	* Re-implement on-screen console

	GFX subsystem:

	* operations.c: Remove the scroll offset (it's obsolete now)
	* operations.c: Add full support for state->visible_map


Bonus goals:
	+ pic_0.c: Fix artifact removal to check surrounding pixels for
	  occurences of	white before removing a white pixel
	+ pic_0.c: Fix white spots in QfG1 forest
	+ pic_0.c: Fix black line on left side in Erana's Peace
	* bi- or trilinear pixmap filter
	* pic_0.c: Add SCI01 support (priority palettes and embedded views)
	* pal_1.c: Fix palettes not to compress colors (doing this is pointless
	  and wrong)
	* grammar.c: Replace proto-Earley parser with backtracking Earley


*: Normal goal
+: If not met for 0.3.1, the goal will rise up one class
