Thanks for downloading this release of FreeSCI!

This is a development snapshot of FreeSCI. Please do not confuse it with a
working SCI engine.

The FreeSCI distribution currently consists of tools and libraries to allow
the platform-independant usage of SCI resource files. The current goal is
to build an SCI virtual machine which is capable of running at least the
older SCI0 games (like Space Quest 3, King's Quest 4 or Leisure Suit Larry 2
((C) Sierra On-Line, Inc.)) In this process, support for the various
SCI resources will be built and improved, as well as tested. Feel free to
contribute in any way you wish, be it source code, documentation, or bug
reports.

Please refer to 'NEWS' and the 'ChangeLog' for information about changes
in this and previous versions.

Building FreeSCI
----------------

To build the package, type the following:

configure
make


This will try to build several tools:
src/tools/classes - lists all SCI classes
src/tools/console - A command console for inspection of SCI data
src/tools/sciunpack - A tool for unpacking and converting SCI resource data
src/tools/scriptdump - disassembles all selector methods into SCI assembly
src/tools/vocabdump - Displays kernel function and selector names (obsolete)
src/sciv - The main executable; this loads, links and runs SCI bytecode.


Required 'non-standard' libraries:
 * glib (ftp://ftp.gtk.org)
 * libpng (http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png)
 * GGI (ftp://ftp.ggi-project.org)

libpng is a new requirement (it was previously listed as "not being
neccessary", sorry for that.


Running it
----------

To run FreeSCI, execute 'sciv' while you are in a directory containing
Sierra resource files (resource.000, resource.001, etc). This will open
a ggi visual, and wait for input on the console you started it from
(Therefore, you should only run it under X).
At the moment, FreeSCI only supports SCI0 games, up to and including
Quest for Glory 2.
You will start up in the built-in debugger. Execute "sret" to let the
vm run until it finishes or crashes, and watch things move (or break,
depending on the game you're testing).
For further debug commands, refer to the documentation file, doc/sci.sgml,
written for the docbook DTD. If you don't have sgml tools to convert the
file, you can either have a look at the docbook sources, or examine the
documentation section on the FreeSCI home page.

For a list of all commands supported by the debugger (it supports the debug
commands listed in the documentation, plus the default command line commands
like "play" to convert and play music over the gsi sound server), type
"list cmds" on the debugger command line. Use "man command" to learn about
the specified command.


Configuration
-------------

FreeSCI will create a directory called .freesci in your home directory (unless
this directory already exists). If you run an SCI game, this game will
create another directory inside the .freesci directory, to store
its save games in (later on).
Also, if a file called "config" exists in this directory, it will be read
and parsed by the interpreter after the game has been loaded. At this
time, the configuration file may contain:
- Comments preceeded by a hash '#' sign
- version = x.yyy.zzz: emulate SCI version x.yyy.zzz. The version number
  is sometimes printed on game discs, or can be found out by
  grepping your main executable for "0.000." (for SCI0 games). It is
  also displayed if the built-in debugger is activated in the Sierra SCI
  engine.
- color_mode = dither | flat | dither256: (only one of those three modes).
  dither: Draw in 16 colors, same as Sierra SCI.
  flat: Interpolate colors (256 colors). Improves some graphics.
  dither256: Dither in 256 colors. A compromise between dither and flat.
- [GAME_ID]: Commands following this line will only have an effect for
  the game with the specified game ID. (The game ID is printed during
  sciv startup, and is also used to create the save game directory).
- resource_dir: Read the game's resource data from the specified location.
  Must not be used in the generic part of the config file.

Example:
------------------------
# FreeSCI config file

version = 0.000.685
color_mode = flat

# default to interpolated color mode and interpreter version 0.000.685

[Glory]

color_mode = dither256
resource_dir = /usr/local/share/freesci/qg1
# Quest for glory looks better in that mode

[SQ3]

version = 0.000.453
resource_dir = /home/bob/stuff/misc/other/games/more/sierra/old/sq/3
# This SQ3 version is ancient
-----------------------



Notes
-----


Successful builds have been reported for the following platforms:
- i686-pc-linux-gnu
- sparc-sun-solaris2.5
- DEC Alpha running Linux

Please note that most of the documentation found in the doc/misc subdirectory
is random information copied from the SCI Decoding Project homepage and
from homepages of various of its members.
Some of the source code contained in the doc/ directory, namely sd.c, sde.c,
sdv.c, script.java and decrypt.c, was created by Carl Muckenhoupt who has
given permission for it or parts of it to be ported and/or included in this
distribution.
Other source code, such as scr000.txt and scr_code.cpp, was copied from public
sources without the knowledge of its authors.

In order to do something useful, you need all of the resource files of any
SCI0 game in your current working directory before running one of the programs
from this package. These resource files and everything they contain are
property and copyrighted by Sierra On-Line (which in turn is a trademark
of Sierra On-Line, Inc.).
