Thanks for downloading the first alpha release of FreeSCI!

FreeSCI is a portable interpreter for SCI games, such as the Space Quest
series (starting with SQ3) or Leisure Suit Larry (2 and sequels); see
below for a complete (?) listing.

FreeSCI is incomplete. You will not be able to finish any SCI game with it.
This release has the following limitations (plus some bugs):
- Only SCI0 games are supported
- The SCI debug functions aren't fully supported (and probably never will be,
  since we're using our own debug functions).
- Sound is not supported yet
- Graphics are slow, especially on displays not using 8bpp color index mode.

It has the following improvements over Sierra SCI:
- SCI0 background pictures can be rendered in 256 colors
- saving and restoring the game state is possible from more places than the
  Sierra SCI engine allowed (using the debugger functions)
- Better debugger (we think :-)
- readline-style editing is supported in edit controls


Note that there are some known graphical issues related to windows popping
up over animations, windows with decorated borders, and text removal. These
problems will be addressed in an upcoming re-implementation of the graphics
subsystem.

This is ALPHA sofware. That means that there are lot of bugs, and some non-
fundamental things (regarding graphics and sound support) have not been
implemented yet.


Please refer to 'NEWS' and the 'ChangeLog' for information about changes
in this and previous versions.

Building FreeSCI
----------------

To build the package, type the following:

configure
make


This will try to build several tools:
src/tools/classes - lists all SCI classes
src/tools/sciconsole - A command console for inspection of SCI data
src/tools/listwords - Lists all words (except for suffix alternatives)
		      understood by the game
src/tools/scidisasm - Disassembles all script resources into .script files
src/tools/sciunpack - A tool for unpacking and converting SCI resource data
src/tools/scriptdump - disassembles all selector methods into SCI assembly
src/tools/vocabdump - Displays kernel function and selector names (obsolete)
src/sciv - The main executable; this loads, links and runs SCI bytecode.


Required 'non-standard' libraries:
 * glib (ftp://ftp.gtk.org)
 * libpng (http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png)
 * GGI (ftp://ftp.ggi-project.org)
	-or-
 * Any OpenGL with glx implementation (strictly experimental!)

libpng is a new requirement (it was previously listed as "not being
neccessary", sorry for that).


Running it under UNIX-like OSses
--------------------------------

To run FreeSCI, execute 'sciv' while you are in a directory containing
Sierra resource files (resource.000, resource.001, etc), or set up a
~/.freesci/config file as described below and run 'sciv <gameID>'. This
will try to run the SCI game; it will abort as soon as it encounters an
error and enter debug mode. In debug mode, type "quit" to leave the
interpreter. If you stumbled over a bug that isn't listed on the FreeSCI
bug list (http://freesci.linuxgames.com/bugs.html) yet, please contact
one of the maintainers and send him a short description of the problem you
encountered.

For further debug commands, refer to the documentation file, doc/sci.sgml,
written for the docbook DTD. If you don't have sgml tools to convert the
file, you can either have a look at the docbook sources, or examine the
documentation section on the FreeSCI home page.

For a list of all commands supported by the debugger, type "list cmds" at
the debugger command line. Use "man <command>" to learn about the specified
command.


Configuration
-------------

FreeSCI will create a directory called .freesci in your home directory (unless
this directory already exists). If you run an SCI game, this game will
create another directory inside the .freesci directory, to store
its save games in (later on).
Also, if a file called "config" exists in this directory, it will be read
and parsed by the interpreter after the game has been loaded. At this
time, the configuration file may contain:
- Comments preceeded by a hash '#' sign

- version = x.yyy.zzz: emulate SCI version x.yyy.zzz. The version number
  is sometimes printed on game discs, or can be found out by
  grepping your main executable for "0.000." (for SCI0 games). It is
  also displayed if the built-in debugger is activated in the Sierra SCI
  engine.

- pic0_dither_mode = dither | flat | dither256: (only one of those three modes).
  dither: Draw in 16 colors, same as Sierra SCI.
  flat: Interpolate colors (256 colors). Improves some graphics.
  dither256: Dither in 256 colors. A compromise between dither and flat.

- pic0_dither_pattern = scaled | 1
  scaled: Dither in axb sized blocks, if x scale is a and y scale is b
  1: Dither in 1x1 blocks (single pixels)

- pic0_brush_mode = scaled | ellipses | random-ellipses | more-random
  Affects how semi-random brushes (used mostly for dirt and foilage) are drawn:
  scaled: Scale every semi-random pixel to a rectangular block
  ellipses: Scale every semi-random pixel to a filled ellipse
  random-ellipses: As ellipses, but slightly shift ellipse offset and size
  more-random: Add more random pixels to the whole area

- pic0_line_mode = correct | fine
  correct: Draw lines appropriately scaled
  fine: Don't scale lines (thin lines, may cause problems) 

- dirty_strategy = 1 | clusters
  The "dirty strategy" is the strategy used to collect modifications to the
  screen content. Modifying this may affect performance on slow or networked
  systems.
  1: Collect everything in one dirty region
  clusters: Cluster non-overlapping modified regions into a set of regions 

- pic0_scaled = yes | no
  Whether SCI0 background pics should be scaled (may look better) or not
  (faster, looks more like the original games)

- pic_buffer_size = #
  Number of background pics to store in an LRU buffer. Increasing this value
  will increase the amount of memory used, but may considerably speed up
  changing back to rooms you visited not too long ago.

- mouse = yes | no
  Whether the interpreter should report to the game that it has a mouse.

- [GAME_ID]: Commands following this line will only have an effect for
  the game with the specified game ID. (The game ID is printed during
  sciv startup, and is also used to create the save game directory).

- resource_dir: Read the game's resource data from the specified location.
  Must not be used in the generic part of the config file.

Example:
------------------------
# FreeSCI config file

version = 0.000.685
color_mode = flat

# default to interpolated color mode and interpreter version 0.000.685

[Glory]

color_mode = dither256
# Quest for glory looks better in that mode
resource_dir = /usr/local/share/freesci/qg1

[SQ3]

version = 0.000.453
# This SQ3 version is ancient
resource_dir = /home/bob/stuff/misc/other/games/more/sierra/old/sq/3
-----------------------


Potentially supported games
---------------------------

The following games have been tested with FreeSCI and are known to give some
level of interactivity:
- Hero's Quest / Quest for Glory 1
- Space Quest 3
- King's Quest 4
- Leisure Suit Larry 2
- Leisure Suit Larry 3
- Police Quest 2
- Codename: Iceman
- The Colonel's Bequest (*)
- Conquest of Camelot (*)
- The Fun Seeker's Guide (from the SQ Collector's Series)
- Hoyle's Book of Games (volume 1)
- Hoyle's Book of Games (volume 2)

(*) These games are known to have major graphical problems. Fixing them will
require a re-design of the graphics engine.

In theory, FreeSCI should be able to let you complete all of these.

---------

Successful builds have been reported for the following platforms (in order of
appearance):
- i686-pc-linux-gnu
- sparc-sun-solaris2.5
- sgi-mips-irix6.2 (Indy R5000 using native cc, experimental)
- alphaev67-debian-gnu-linux

The following platforms used to be supported, but have not been tested for this
release:

- ia32/FreeBSD
- ia32/NetBSD
- ia32/DOS



Notes
-----

Please note that most of the documentation found in the doc/misc subdirectory
is random information copied from the SCI Decoding Project homepage and
from homepages of various of its members.
Some of the source code contained in the doc/ directory, namely sd.c, sde.c,
sdv.c, script.java and decrypt.c, was created by Carl Muckenhoupt who has
given permission for it or parts of it to be ported and/or included in this
distribution.
Other source code, such as scr000.txt and scr_code.cpp, was copied from public
sources without the knowledge of its authors.

In order to do something useful, you need all of the resource files of any
SCI0 game in your current working directory before running one of the programs
from this package. These resource files and everything they contain are
property and copyrighted by Sierra On-Line (which in turn is a registerd
trademark of Sierra On-Line, Inc.).
Space Quest, Quest for Glory, King's Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Police Quest,
Codename: Iceman, Conquest of Camelot, and The Colonel's Bequest are registered
