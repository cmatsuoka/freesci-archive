            greater!  It's a work-in-progress, and is combined with a
            gradual refactoring of the soundserver code to share the
            same core.  Test the sound code HEAVILY.  :)

	  changes.

	* src/scicore/console.c, src/include/console.h: New functions

	* src/engine/kgraphics.c (collides_with): Now reads nsrect directly
	from object

	* src/gfx/drivers/ggi_driver.c:
	* src/gfx/drivers/xlib_driver.c: Added driver-specific config options

                  to the Xlib driver.  It is much much faster now.  :)
	* src/sound/soundserver_null.c:   Fixed the fading code so that
                  now 0x0000 is treated as "everything", or a regular
                  handle will also be good.  Also, restore insturment
                  set whenever the song changes.  And lastly, my last
                  commit broke the sending of valid MIDI CC events.

2001-03-14  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@theta.darmstadt.gmd.de>

	to 20, which is the number of savegames allowed in later versions
	of SCI

	* src/main.c (lookup_driver): Starting up with invalid midiout
	drivers, midi devices, or graphics drivers now aborts with an
	error message written in large, friendly letters

	* src/engine/vm.c (lookup_selector): Looking for the superclass
	now carries the result of a CLASS_ADDRESS() call for static
	instantiations. This avoids the problem that this call may some-

	* src/core/kfile.c (kGetSaveFiles): Implemented GetSaveFiles().

	* src/core/kernel.c (kSetDebug): Wrote short implementation for
	SetDebug(), made FlushResources() NOP without warning (we don't need

	* src/graphics/input_ggi.c (_sci_ggi_input_handler): Fixed ggi input
	handler bug that would interpret '0' as INS.

	* src/console: Killed the console subdirectory and distributed the
	sources in src/core and src/graphics. The console design is a bit
	cleaner now.

1999-12-15  Dmitry Jemerov  <yole@nnz.ru>

	headers to make things more portable for non-POSIX systems.

1999-11-27  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/kernel.c (_k_view_list_dispose_loop): Fixed the bug
	(more like a missing feature) that caused the game to run out of
	background buffers. At least I hope so.
	(kFormat): Fixed the %c formatting bug that would cause a % to be
	printed instead of the character immediately following the %c.
	(kBaseSetter): BaseSetter now takes view offsets into consideration.
	This doesn't affect SQ3, but might help with other games.

	* src/include/engine.h (_state): Made sure that &rest is saved
	correctly (this only helps with debugging, of course).

	* acinclude.m4: Improved (?) the config maker scripts. Now,
	instead of checking libraries by looking for files with corresponding
	names, png, (n)curses and ggi are tried to link against; this should
	help with cross-compiling.

1999-11-26  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/graphics/graphics_ggi.c (libggi_redraw): Fixed GGI screen
	shaking.

	* config.l: conf.console_log is now allocated by strdup, to avoid
	attempt to free the same buffer multiple times.

	* src/core/scriptdebug.c (disassemble): When disassembling the jmp
        instruction, the destination offset is also printed.

1999-11-26  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/console/console.c (sciprintf): Fixed sciprintf for result
	strings longer than 255 bytes (the problem was caused by a difference
	in vsnprintf behaviour between older glibc versions and glibc 2.1/
	other libcs)

	* src/core/kernel.c: Killed the bug that made QfG1 stop with the
 	PC set to 0 in the main menu sometimes. It was caused by the dynamic
	view lists not being cleared automatically during DrawPic...

1999-11-25  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/kernel.c (_k_make_view_list): Potential fix for the
	Attack Of The 15' Killer Woman bug in Iceman. One of our better

1999-11-25  Rink Springer <rink@rink.cx>

        * src/core/vocab_debug.c (vocabulary_get_opcodes): Added check for NULL
          return of findResource () to avoid segmentation fault in scriptdump

1999-11-25  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/scriptdebug.c (script_debug): Added functions to the
	sound driver protocol to support suspending (and, afterwards,
	resuming) all sound. Used this to prevent most causes of sound
	server deaths by SIGPIPEs.

1999-11-22  Lars Skovlund <lskovlun@worldonline.dk>

	* src/core/kernel.c (kDisplay): Fixed a bug in kDisplay which was the
	  cause for the "blue buttons" in QFG1 (ports must be preserved across
	  kernel calls!)

1999-11-21  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/vocab.c (vocab_get_suffices): Fixed suffix reading, which
	simply didn't work (thanks to Rink Springer for pointing this out!)

1999-11-20  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/main.c (main): Fixed a cause for segfaults that would strike
	if sciv was started without a game name to use

	* src/core/kernel.c (kParse): Updated parser to call wordFail correctly
	(invoke_selector): Fixed a bug that could make kernel functions in the
	backtrace list look strange, and another one that would write incorrect
	parameters if invoke_selector was called with more than zero of them
	(caused by a macro evaluating va_arg() twice).

1999-11-14  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/sound/sfx_save.cfsml: Implemented persistance for the sound
	subsystem. Sound data is written to "(savedir)/sound" as plain text,
	while songs are dumped binarily into "(savedir)/song.*".

	* src/core/cfsml.pl: Changed all fucntion declarations to static;
	this should help with programs using CFSML generated code in more than
	one place.

1999-11-14  Dmitry Jemerov  <yole@exch.nnz.spb.su>

	* Fixed Visual C++ build problems all around the code.

	* src/graphics/engine_graphics.c (graph_draw_selector_edit):
	Fixed memory corruption that occurred when a 0 length string was
	passed in the text parameter. Fixed drawing cursor not in the
	end of text string.

	* src/core/kernel.c (kOnControl): Fixed several keyboard handling
	problems.

	* src/graphics/graphics_ddraw.c (WndProc): The tilde key is now

	* src/core/cfsml.pl: Fixed a bug that would cause the number of
	array elements to be too low by one if MAXWRITE was used.

	* src/core/kernel.c (kShakeScreen): Implemented ShakeScreen. The
	gfx_driver->Redraw protocol was extended to allow y parameters for
	this- this means that gfx drivers w/o shakescreen don't need to
	worry about this feature.

	* src/core/savegame.cfsml : Implemented saving/restoring the game
	state. Everything seems to save and restore cleanly, except for the
	sound driver (saving/restoring still needs to be implemented there).

1999-11-07  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/config.l (config_init): Added another config option,
	"resource_dir", to the config file parser. This makes it possible
	to run a game with a command like "sciv lsl2".

1999-10-20  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/vm.c (run_vm): Re-implemented parts of the vm so that
	a new vm is only started from kernel functions. The program stack
	is now stored on a local stack (again, except for calls into user
	space from kernel functions) which should make it possible to store
	and load the game state under most conditions.

1999-10-15  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/vocab_debug.c (vocabulary_get_knames0): Added handling for
	missing vocab.999 (falls back to a default kernel name table)

	* src/graphics/graphics_ggi.c (graphics_draw_region_ggi): Added a hack
	for bigendian machines that could solve the blank screen problem
	without too much performance loss (still needs to be tested)

	* src/sound/soundserver_null.c: Removed warnings

1999-09-04  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

1999-08-29  Dmitry Jemerov  <yole@exch.nnz.spb.su>

        * src/core/vm.c: Breakpoints on object methods do not trigger on
        super calls.

        * src/core/scriptdebug.c (c_backtrace): Super calls are now
        shown correctly in the back trace.
        (c_stepover, script_debug) New debugger command 'so' to step over
        sends and calls.
        (c_disasm) disasm command always printed one more command than
        requested. Now disasm stops after a 'ret' is encountered instead
        of printing a series of bnot's. If the first argument of disasm
        is less or equal than 0, it is treated as an offset from pc.
        (c_bpdel, script_debug) New debugger command 'bpdel' to delete
        breakpoints.

        * src/config.l: Brought back the debug_mode parameter.

        * src/graphics/graphics_ddraw.c (WndProc): Mouse cursor is redrawn
        during waits. Windows mouse cursor is not shown over the freesci
        window.

1999-08-28  Dmitry Jemerov  <yole@exch.nnz.spb.su>

        * src/core/scriptdebug.c (c_snk): Now it's possible to specify
        not only function name, but also function index as snk parameter.

        * src/include/vm.h, src/include/engine.h, src/core/scriptdebug.c,
        src/core/vm.c: Added breakpoint support.

        * src/core/kernel.c (kScriptID): Fixed a long-standing bug in
        GetScriptID that was masked by an ugly patch: The dispatch table
        index is 0-based, not 1-based. That fixes the EgoWaterViewer
        problem in Codename: Iceman. (kEditControl): Event modifiers are
        handled correctly. (kGetEvent) removed "stub" mark.

        * src/graphics/graphics_ddraw.c: Added support for Caps Lock,
        Num Lock and keypad keys. Again fixed to work with Magnus'
        latest changes.

1999-08-26  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/sound/soundserver_null.c: Added support for sound command 0xc
	(assumed to be "Stop All") to both ends of the pipes.

	* src/sound/sound.c (song_lib_remove): Fixed one more evil bug that
	caused circular references.

	(kGraph): Implemented FILL_BOX_ANY and UPDATE_BOX

1999-08-26  Dmitry Jemerov  <yole@exch.nnz.spb.su>
        * src/core/kernel.c (kFOpen) using UPARAM(0) instead of
        PARAM(0) (fixes a crash in LSL3). (kOnControl) now supports
        calling with 2 or 4 parameters (as it had in PQ2 - fixes
        a crash with it). (kIsObject) fixed another problem with
        PQ2.
        * src/core/scriptdebug.c (disassemble): Heap offsets are
        now printed for each disassembled command.

1999-08-25  Dmitry Jemerov  <yole@exch.nnz.spb.su>
        * src/main.c (main): Added support for command line options.
        Added options --gamedir (-d), --run (-r), --sci-version (-v).
        * src/*/graphics*.*, kernel/kernel.c, kernel/resource.c:
        Converted sci_usleep() to a graphics driver-specific function
        (gfx_driver.Wait()).
        * src/core/kernel.c, src/include/kdebug.h: SCIkdebug/SCIkwarn
        output is also echoed to console_log file. Added new debug
        message category, SCIkGFXDRIVER. Moved debugging function
        prototypes to the header file.
        * src/core/scriptdebug.c: Added support for SCIkGFXDRIVER to
        c_debuglog(). Moved part of c_debuglog() to a separate function
        set_debug_mode().
        * src/graphics/graphics_ddraw.c: Converted all debugging output
        to SCIkdebug/SCIkwarn. Added support for fullscreen mode. Added
        event processing code.
        * src/include/sci_conf.h, src/main.c, src/config.l: Added
        debug_mode parameter.
        * src/tools/vocabdump.c: now prints selector indexes; added
        printing of class table.
        * src/core/script.c (printMethod): when disassembling the
        <class> opcode, the correct class name is printed.
        * src/include/versions.h, src/core/vm.c: Added support
        (version-dependent) for 4 byte script headers.

        added missing vocabulary_free_snames()
        * console/commands.c, core/script.c: moved code of c_dissectscript()
        into a separate function script_dissect(); moved sci_hexdump()
        to script.c. Implemented dumping of string blocks in more human
        readable way.
        * include/console.h, console/console.c (sciprintf): added
        possibility of echoing sciprintf() output to a text file
        * tools/sciunpack.c: Added --dissect flag allowing to dump script
        resources to human readable text. Added possibility to specify
        "*" instead of resource number to unpack all resources of given
        type.
        * config.l, include/graphics.h, include/graphics_ddraw.h,
        graphics/graphics_ddraw.c, graphics/graphics_ggi.c:
        Implemented driver-specific configuration parameters.
        * include/graphics.h, graphics/graphics_ddraw.c,
        graphics/graphics_ggi.c: Copied new color interpolation code
        from the libggi driver to the DirectDraw driver.
        * config.l, main.c: Implemented console_log config parameter
        specifying the file to which console output should be echoed.
        * main.c: Added myself to the copyrights. :-)

1999-08-20  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/kernel.c (kInitBresen): Fixed a bug in the bresenham
	implementation.

1999-08-19  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/kernel.c: Fixed CanBeHere() according to Lars' specs.
	Implemented DirLoop, CoordPri, PriCoord, ValidPath, RespondsTo,
	FOpen, FPuts, FGets, FClose, TimesSin/SinMult, TimesCos/CosMult.
	Fixed a stupid bug in CanBeHere() where an object could clip
	against itself.

1999-08-17  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/kernel.c (kDrawCel): Added DrawCel.

	* src/main.c: Added support for a config file (the parser can be
	generated from the flex file config.l).

	* src/core/kernel.c: Fixed countless bugs, implemented numerous kernel
	functions. It's been a while since I last updated this file, so I'm
	unable to go into any more detail. The last functions I added were
	InitBresen, DoBresen, CanBeHere.

1999-08-09  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/kernel.c (kFormat): Fixed kFormat according to Lars'
	specs.

1999-08-05  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/graphics/engine_graphics.c: Added a new file for some fancy
	thinge like backupping (up-backing?) and restoring parts of the screen
	maps and text rendering.

	* src/core/kernel.c (kAnimate): Added Animate(), Display(), partial
	Graph().

1999-08-03  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/graphics/graphics.c (drawView0): Fixed a bug that would over-
	write the port border (and mess up a lot of other things).
	Threadsafed the whole graphics stuff.

1999-08-02  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/scriptdebug.c (c_sret): Successfully tested the new sret
	debug command (Step until RETurning from current level) which is simi-
	larly useful as the Sierra SCI TAB key (skip send), but works the
	way around (i.e. it doesn't skip the next function, it waits until the
	current function terminates).

	* src/core/kernel.c (kClone): Fixed a bug where cloning would corrupt
	the heap

	* src/core/vm.c (execute): Fixed a bug where the 'super' operation
	would start execution with the base object set to the superclass
	of the calling object as opposed to the calling object itself
	(QfG1, step 1072 / Glory::startRoom)
	(execute): Fixed two bugs with indexed variable operations (like
	sali, sspi or +agi) where the accumulator wasn't bit-expanded as
	neccessary and where + and - operations wrote back to the wrong ad-
	dress.

	* src/core/kernel.c: Added Clone, DisposeClone, ScriptID

	* src/core/scriptdebug.c (c_listclones): Added listclones debug
	function to list all clones

	* src/console/commands.c (c_dissectscript): Fixed a bug that would
	read too far, possibly causing a segfault with efence

1999-07-30  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/kernel.c: Added OnControl and a few trivial functions
	(Random, Abs, Sqrt, HaveMouse, GetAngle, GetDistance)

1999-07-29  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/kernel.c: Fixed Load, Unload, added PicNotValid and Show.

1999-07-27  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/vm.c (execute_method): Fixed calle/callb madness and some
	other bugs.

1999-07-25  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/kernel.c: Added new kernel functions.

	* src/core/vm.c (execute): Fixed a bunch of bugs and added dynamic
	class loading to the class opcode.

1999-07-23  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/vm.c (script_run): Finished the VM. In Theory.

1999-07-18  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/core/vocabulary.c (vocabulary_get_snames): Tracked down a
	nasty little bug in name getting. This one was so simple that it
	was a killer- it's possible that it was at least part of the
	cause for the memory corruption which haunted us in our sleeps.

1999-07-11  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* src/graphics/graphics.c (drawView0): Views appear to clip correctly
	to ports and windows now.

	* src/graphics/window.c (drawWindow): Implemented SCI0-style text boxes
	with the usual headers. Still needs to be tested, but it looks adequate
	for the time being. Still, one port-related clipping bugs will have to
	be squashed now.

	* src/sound/midi.c: Thanks to Shane T., the quality of instrument
	mapping should have improved now (the PQ2 instrument mappings were
	very helpful).
	Unmapped instruments now are ignored when generating the MIDI data,
	instead of being mapped to a wrong instrument.

1999-06-28  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/console/commands.c (c_hexgrep): Added a function for non-regexp
	grepping for particular hex sequences. Also added a new parameter type
	for bytes in hexadecimal representation and changed the '*' parameter
	type to repeat the last param type 0 or more types.
	(c_list): Fixed another braindead bug reported by Chris Lansdown.

1999-06-27  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/core/resource.c (loadResourcePatches): Added loading of
	resource patches (can be overridden when calling loadResources())

	* src/core/heap.c: Added Magnus' implementation of the SCI heap.
	Still needs to be hooked up to libscicore.

	* Accidently killed some files. Entries to the changelog have been
	lost; here's a quick summary:

	* Applied fixes from Magnus for the VM/Vocab/Script stuff

	* Applied fixes from Chris Lansdown for configure.in and resource.c

	* Forced tools/console.c to use libreadline instead of libgii.
	This still needs to be checked for, so that we can evade to gets()
	if readline is not available.

	* Fixed cursor drawing for SCI0 based on Chris Lansdown's hints

	* Modified graphics code to allow for multilayered pictures (like
	the SQ3 title screen, which consists of the "Space Quest 3" logo
	and the "the Pirates of Pestulon" thing, which is a separate pic
	resource)

	* Renamed picture resources to pic resources for Resource_Types;
	this is because SCI0 calls them pics and not pictures.

1999-06-18  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* configure.in: Uses AM_PATH_GLIB now instead of the home-made
	AC_PATH_GLIB.

	* src/tools/sciunpack.c (main): Unpacking behaviour now equals Carl
	Muckenhoupt's SCI decoder's behaviour, i.e. it writes an SCI header
	before the SCI data block. This means that the resulting files can
	be directly used as patches.

	* src/core/decompress1.c (decompress1): Thanks to a hint from Ravi
	at the SCI message board, decompression now works for all SCI01
	resources. This means that QfG2 will, in theory, should be supported
	for the public release (without sound support, however).

1999-06-14  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/core/vocabulary.c (_vocabulary_get_knames0alt): Added a new
	function to deal with non-standard vocab.999 resources.

1999-06-13  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/graphics/graphics.c (clearpage): Changed default background
	color to 15, which fixes several problems and is consistant with the
	way Sierra used to do things (TWSUTDT).

1999-06-12  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/sound/midi.c: Added MIDI mapping magic. It's still not perfect,
	but much better (and more extensible) than the previous solution.

1999-06-10  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/graphics/mcursor.c: Fixed both cursor drawing functions to
	properly clip. SCI1 cursors are now displayed correctly, too (tested
	this with a small hack that allowed loading the QG2 resources without
	decompressing picture resources)

1999-06-09  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/graphics/graphics_ggi.c (initColors): Fixed a small bug that
	would prevent color 0xff to be set correctly in 256 color mode.

1999-06-08  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* Decided to release 0.2.0. The actual release date will proabably be
	tomorrow, though.

	* src/tools/console.c: Added a text-based command console. It doesn't
	work the way it's supposed to, though- libgii(stdin) appears to
	deliver events in a different fashion than libggi does.

	* src/console/console.c: A number of commands has been added to the
	command console in the last few days. While the command console
	doesn't beat the bash (yet ;-), it's in a state where working with it
	is possible. As long as working is limited to inspecting and frobbing
	valies, and calling some pre-defined commands.

1999-06-07  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/sound/sound.c: Fixed a bug when setting the gsi volume (the
	request would be prepared but not flushed).

1999-06-06  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/console/console.c: Finished the first phase of work on the
	command console. It should now be possible to hook up commands to
	it.

1999-06-05  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/graphics/input_ggi.c: Completed (?) work on the ggi input
	driver.

1999-06-04  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/include/uinput.h: Added an input interface of sorts. It's
	supposed to be portable to non-ggi interfaces, but I'm not sure if
	it will work for all of them. Well, making things as portable and
	universal as possible is one of the design goals, so I should try
	to look for any possible alternatives and include some way to use
	them.
	I'll get back to this right after I finish my research on the cure
 	for cancer and the TransWarp drive.

	* src/graphics/graphics_ggi.c (displayPicture): After noticing the
	significant lack of redraw speed in some preliminary input tests, I
	redid the display code, using ggiPutHLine(). The resulting speedup
	was considerable. Also made displayPicture() autodetect if the visual
	is double-sized, so displayDoublePicture() won't be necessary in the
	future.

1999-06-02  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* Merged Magnus' patches to the vocab and script resource handlers.
	Now this rocks- both vocab and script dumping appear to work without
	any problems!

	* src/graphics/mcursor.c (drawMouseCursor0): Added a drawing function
	for SCI0 mouse cursors.

1999-05-29  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/graphics/graphics.c: Added support for 'interpolated mode' when
	drawing the graphics. Both graphics_ggi.c and graphics_png.c have been
	updated to support this.

	* src/core/resource.c (loadResources): Fixed a nasty but stupid bug
	that made the last release unuseable.

1999-05-24  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/sound/sound.c: Added some general functions to ease interfacing
	with different sound systems (currently, only GSI is supported).

	* src/graphics/graphics_png.c: Added support for picture_ts to be
	stored as .png files. Practical use for this is limited, though.

	* src/tools/sciunpack.c (main): Created sciunpack to merge unpack and
	resourcelist. This tool includes functions for converting sound
	and picture resources to midi and png files, respectively.

	* Changed several function names to improve clarity. All functions
	succeeded by a zero are only applicable to SCI0 resources.

1999-05-23  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/sound/midi.c (makeMIDI0): Preliminary MIDI support has been
	added. However, Sierra appears to use a proprietary MIDI instrument
	mapping scheme (which comes at no surprise; AFAIK the GM specification
	wasn't comissioned until somewhen in 199x), and therefore the
	instruments (including percussions) appear to be somewhat messy.
	Fixing this instrument mapping will be an ongoing task.

1999-05-13  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/graphics/graphics.c (drawView): Performance of drawView() has
	been improved. It's not perfect yet (even if color==transparency,
	each pixel is checked), but it should be *much* better than its
	predecessor.
	Also, I think that I found the "reversed" flag which some of the
	views apparently use to draw the same data in two different ways.

	* Fixed several endianness bugs (mainly in font.c and graphics.c).
	qg1demo now runs on sparc-solaris 2.5, although the colors are messed
	up.

	* src/core/resource.c (loadResources): Allowed resource.000 not to
	exist (loading starts at resource.001 in this case). This situation
	can be found in SQ3.

	* src/core/decompress.c (decompress): Added check for objects with
	size zero to avoid segfault.

1999-05-10  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* configure.in : Added support for passing the location of ggi
	during configure time.

1999-05-09  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* src/graphics/graphics.c (main): Fixed a bug with transparency:
	contrary to my prior expectations, all sprites DO carry a trans-
	parency value. Also made the line and fill functions behave more
	like the original. So far, I've had no problems with lines, but
	filling still gives me headaches.

1999-05-08  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* Improved error handling for the resource loader and parts of the
	decompression stuff.

	* Moved all of the (u)int* types to g(u)int*, which are exported by
	glib.

1999-05-05  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* Released 0.1.1

	* Kicked autoconf and automake until they would tell me the byte
	sizes of the various data types. Together with Magnus' machine-
	independent getInt (now called getInt16) the new data types should
	greatly improve portability.

	* Merged Magnus' script and vocabulary resource code into the
	distribution. Wrote some small testing utilities for them.

1999-04-03  Christoph Reichenbach  <creichen@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* First public release.
